#<<purpose>>
It is my purpose to explore an area of the public discourse on mathematics education. That is, the discussion at the national level of the mathematics achievement gaps in the US school system. The specific subject of the teaching of mathematics has achieved great importance because of its purported relevance in an increasingly technological and fiercely competitive global world.  Also, this field of research is historically interesting because it looks back to the roots Western civilization and modern thought, the Greece of the great philosophers as well as the trade and irrigation based nations of Egypt and Mesopotamia. 

A visual representation of the level of interest in the subject of the mathematics achievement gap is give by Google Books NGrams.[fn:17]  These graphs display over time the frequency of occurrence of certain words or word groups in the corpus of U.S. books.  Figure \ref{fig:ME-AG} shows the trend of occurrence of the bigrams "math education" and "achievement gap" and figure \ref{fig:global-competition} shows the same for the bigram "global competition".  It is obvious that these subjects have become more and more popular since the 1960s.

We will see that there are several kinds of AGs.  However, there are two principal types in mathematics education. The first one is the disparity of the mathematics (and science) scores in the /Programme for International Student Assessment/ (PISA)[fn:1] and of the /Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study/ (TIMMS),[fn:2] and the second one is the existence, as well as stubborn persistence, of the national and international achievement gaps \cite<see e.g.>{Braun:2006a}.

It actually is better to speak about /Achievement Gap/ (AG) in the plural rather than in the singular. We can group achievement gaps into two broad categories, the /International Achievement Gap/ (IAG) and the /National Achievement Gap/ (NAG). In the literature the IAG can be referred to as the "global achievement gap" \cite{Wagner:2008a}, "transnational achievement gap" \cite{Rindermann:2009a}, or "international achievement differences" \cite{Stedman:1997a}.  In contrast, the NAG is can be denoted as "race gap" \cite{Bali:2003a}, "Black-White achievement gap" \cite{Bali:2004a,Braun:2006a,Levitt:2004a}, "African-American/white achievement gap" \cite{Haycock:2001a}, "minority achievement gap" \cite{Holloway:2004a}, "racial achievement gap" \cite{Lashaw:2010a,Wenglinsky:2004a}, "teaching gap" \cite{Stigler:2009a,Berry:2009a}, and "minority-majority achievement gap" \cite{White:2009a}.  Usually, when we just refer to "achievement gap", "student achievement gap" or "academic achievement gap", the NAG is intended \cite{Balfanz:2006a,Campbell:2005a,Cooper:2006a,DiGisi:2005a,Williams:2003a,Chubb:2002a,Miranda:2007a,Peevely:1999a,Berry:2009a}.  This can be noted from the following quote by \citeA[p. 333]{Maloney:2010a}

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The phrase "achievement gap" in education and political circles signifies the long-term and steady score gap between white, black, and Hispanic/Latino youth on standardized tests. Using the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and SAT scores, researchers have shown that this gap, first recognized in the 1960s, fell by 20% to 40% (depending on the estimate) in the 1970s and 1980s, but then began widening in the late 1990s (Lee 2002; English 2002; Haycock 2001).
#+END_QUOTE

However, others such as \citeA{Downey:2009a} have a more nuanced view (p. 1)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The first important step to take in confronting the achievement gap problem is to abandon the idea that one single thing, or even a few things in combination, will crack this apparently baffling educational conundrum.  And the first factor to confront is that there is no single "achievement gap" but many kinds of gaps. Using a national educational longitudinal data set, Carpenter Ramirez, and Severn (2006) found "not one but multiple achievement gaps, within and between groups" (p. 120) and "gaps between races may not be the most serious of them" (p. 123).
#+END_QUOTE

From a political orientation point of view, those who consider themselves to be liberal or socially progressive are more concerned with the national achievement gap (NAG), and those more conservative and business oriented are more interested in the international achievement gap (IAG).

The international achievement gap is defined and understood in slightly different ways by various authors.  The general concept is that there exists a disparity (gap) between the proficiency of the students in USA and other countries that are considered its "peers."[fn:70]

A recent author on the subject, Tony \citeA[p. xxi]{Wagner:2008a}, defines this /Gap/ as the disparity between the "new skills" needed in "today's highly competitive global knowledge economy" and what the students are taught in class.

A more prosaic understanding of the gap is simply about the ranking of the US in international studies.  This is however a very crude way of understanding the issue.  Ranking is often misleading because the differences in score points are not statistically significant.  For example, the document that in a certain sense started it all, the /A Nation at Risk/ \cite{NCEE:1983a}, was later re-analyzed and much less threatening results were found in the data. According to \citeA{Carson:1993a} the Simpson's paradox made several trends appear to go the opposite of their actual direction. This type of paradox occurs when the statistical data of distinct groups are pooled. That is, each group may exhibit a positive trend, but when combined the overall trend becomes negative. Most statisticians are aware of this paradox, but the layperson can easily be fooled by it.[fn:18] However, according to Lawrence \citeA{Stedman:1994a} there were still reasons for concern even though the situation was not as dire as generally portrayed.  The standardized tests themselves have been subjected to extensive criticisms.  A simple re-norming would make any idea of trends meaningless.

The NAG is not a phenomenon that is restricted to the U.S. Public School System.  It exists also in private schools.  However, it seems that the NAG is narrower in private schools \cite{Coulson:2005a,Neal:1997a}.  Not much is known about the NAG in private schools.  Similarly, little is known about the NAG in home schooling. There again it seems that the gap is narrower if not eliminated \cite[pp. 4--5]{HSLDA:2001a}. However, we should notice that I was able to find only one citation and that it was not peer reviewed.

The achievement gap is now an indelible part of the public discourse on education at all levels. Two are the major markers of this phenomenon. The first one is the publication in 1983 of the report /A Nation at Risk/ \cite{NCEE:1983a},[fn:3] and the second one is the passing of the "No Child Left Behind" Act of 2001.[fn:109] The topic in closely intertwined with burning issues of the U.S. social life such as de-industrialization, globalization, and what can be called the disappearance of "well-paying jobs" for those having only a high school degree or less.[fn:4]

Research on the achievement gaps (AGs) is extensive, and research on the political aspects of the AGs also exists \cite<e.g.>{Apple:1992a,Payne:1999a}, there has been limited research on political discourse regarding the mathematics achievement gap \cite{Martin:2003a,Ellis:2005a}. Very little scholarly research has also been published on Foucault's governmentality and the achievement gaps \cite{Suspitsyna:2010a}. Others have utilized Foucault's concepts without making specific reference to governmentality \cite{Klaf:2010a,Hursh:2007a,Lashaw:2010a}. Ian \citeA[p. 143]{Hunter:1996a} about 5 years ago stated that "Foucault's later work has, to date, had relatively little influence on educational research."

#<<objectives>>
Thus, the objective of the proposed study is to document and analyze the justifications given by the national, that is federal, institutions of the United States for governmental control of mathematics education as function of the achievement gaps in mathematics. This will be done in the light of two closely related social conditions.  More precisely, I want to shed light on the discourses made in the public arena that have legitimized this control and firmly established in the national conscience that the knowledge of mathematics is essential to the prosperity, nay the survival of the nation.

What I am not concerned with is whether the above events and phenomena are the manifestations of an actual, real worsening of the situation in schools in the USA.  I am interested in the *perception* of the health of the public schools by the citizens in general and of the political and economic leadership specifically.  Whether a phenomenon is a /problem/ or not is but a social construct.  Intrinsically nothing is a problem because a problem is a value statement and thus is historically and socially determined.  Furthermore, even if we grant that, e.g., a downtrend in national average SAT mathematics scores is a problem, it still may be a statistical artifact that has only mathematical validity, but does not refer to anything  meaningful in the real world.  Thus, it could be stated, using Foucaultian terminology, that I am problematizing the problematization of the achievement gaps \cite<see e.g.>{Stumbo:2008a,Gutierrez:2008a}.

Funding is but one of the levers that the national government has.  However, it is an important one because it shows a concrete commitment and involvement of political power. Schooling, be it public or private, requires significant financial resources. Functioning schools need money for, among others, teachers and staff payroll, premises, sports fields, buses, books, furniture, cafeteria and office supplies, musical instruments, computers and software, and gym equipment. As we have above mentioned, today in the USA its citizens generally consider it normal that, in one form or another, society has to provide all this money so that all residents in the country have access to free and universal education from kindergarten to 12^th grade.  In addition, as reported previously, the USA is very generous in its public support compared to most other countries in the world.

The national budget by definition is limited, even if in the case of the United States still very large \cite[p. 50]{Hanushek:2009a}.  Hence the necessity for its allocation among entities and interests that are fiercely competing for it.  The outcome of this process of allocation depends on the relative influence and authority of competing constituencies.  The primary and largest items in the federal budget are defense, Medicare & Medicaid, and interest on the national debt.  That ensures that the competition for the remainder of the budget be intense.  Education has to compete with infrastructures, environmental protection, international assistance, law enforcement, block grants, R&D, and a whole host of other interests.

The battle field for this struggle for funding is the public mind.  The sphere of public discourse where attention has to be sought by the use of more or less cogent logic and by the appeal to certain sentiments that are more or less noble.

So, how has the teaching of mathematics fared in this competition for funds?  Why would a government allocate any money at all to this task, what are the justifications for it in the public discourse \cite<see e.g.>[p. 51]{Doherty:2006a}.  In addition, it is helpful to look into the past for any trends and new ideas on this subject.  Some concepts and ideas are novel, others reach back into the past albeit often being called differently.

The teaching of mathematics is in a peculiar situation.  Few school children would choose to study it if they were free to choose.  Many adults would be of the same opinion.  Most adults consider themselves deficient in mathematics.  Basically it is a field of knowledge that few are interested in and knowledgeable about.  On the other hand, mathematics is with English the most frequently tested school subject.  It is in *all* standardized tests: SAT, ACT, GRE, etc.  It is with English a measured subject in the "No Child Left Behind" Act of 2001.[fn:107]

Literacy and numeracy have been considered valuable fields of knowledge since ancient times. However, the learning of reading and writing has always been the primary and often the only skill that was taught. The learning of mathematics was considered much less important than the learning of one's mother tongue and the /lingua franca/.[fn:19] Often the teaching of mathematics was considered unnecessary for the normal students and reserved for the élite. Moreover, when the learning of mathematics was enjoined it was for reasons far from today's concerns.  Plato considered the mathematics of "merchants and retail-traders" a form of knowledge inferior to that which was required of the military and state leaders, who should "study until they see the nature of numbers with their mind only" (Plato, /The Republic/ 525bc).  This attitude towards mathematics lasted until recent times and can still be recognized in the educational polemic called /The Math Wars/ \cite<see e.g.>{Latterell:2005a}.

Returning to the writings of Plato, it is remarkable how a book on, among other subjects, teaching written more than two thousand years ago on another continent can be so promptly related to today's mathematics educational controversies in the USA. We could place Plato in the camp of those who prefer a constructivist inspired way of teaching mathematics versus those who support a procedural, practical pedagogy. For instance

The Republic, Book VII \cite[p. 215]{Bloom:1991a} [fn:78] 

Another idea of Plato that placed him far ahead of its time, was the call for universal education for both girls and boys. This is given in Book VII of his last work, /The Laws/ 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[804c] \ldots we have described buildings for the public gymnasia as well as schools in three divisions within the city, and also in three divisions round about the city training-grounds and race-courses for horses, arranged for archery and other long-distance shooting, and for the teaching and practicing of the youth: if, however, our previous description of these was inadequate, let them now be described and legally regulated.  In all these establishments there should reside teachers [804d] attracted by pay from abroad for each several subject, to instruct the pupils in all matters relating to was and to music; and not father shall either send his son as a pupil or keep him away from the training-school at his own sweet will, but every "man jack" of them all (as the saying goes) must, so far as possible, be compelled to be educated, inasmuch as they are children of the State even more than children of their parents. For females, too, my law will lay down the same regulations as for men, and training of an identical kind.
#+END_QUOTE

If I had describe in a nutshell my proposed study I would state that it is but a commentary on /The Republic/ of Plato focused on the following two statements[fn:97]

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[525bc] Then this is a kind of knowledge which legislation may fitly prescribe; and we must endeavor to persuade those who are prescribed to be the principal men of our State to go and learn arithmetic, not as amateurs, but they must carry on the study until they see the nature of numbers with the mind only; nor again, like merchants or retail-traders, with a view to buying or selling, but for the sake of their military use, and of the soul herself; and because this will be the easiest way for her to pass from becoming to truth and being. (Book VII)
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[405a] And yet what greater proof can there be of a bad and disgraceful state of education than this, that not only artisans and the meaner sort of people need the skill of first-rate physicians and judges, but also those who profess to have had a liberal education?  [405b] Is it not disgraceful, and a great sign of want of good-breeding, that a man should have to go abroad for his law and physic because he has none of his own at home, and must therefore surrender himself into the hands of other men who he makes lords and judges over him?
#+END_QUOTE 

I would like these statements to be my starting point for a journey of investigation that will encounter some great minds, most of them well know and others less so, until we arrive at today's discourse about the national value of mathematical knowledge 

# Alla fine
Here I formulate the hypothesis that when a nation bases its prosperity and future on technology it will place the teaching of mathematics alongside the teaching of the official language in the preservation and enhancement of its national sovereignty. The knowledge of the national language is necessary for internal cohesion and the survival of the culture, while the knowledge of mathematics is essential for its survival as a nation in an environment where commerce, finance, and technology are vital.

Thus it is evident that there is a 'connection' between the state of mathematics education and some social and cultural conditions in the USA.  However, I will dispense with any pretension of being able to explain the historical phenomenon "the policy of mathematics teaching" by any attribution to specific causal mechanism(s). The difficulty of establishing causality does not imply that causality does not exist. However, attribution of causes in history is usually more an indication of the historian's political and ideological ideas than any reference to the discovery of any actual causal agent that connects without any solution of discontinuity the events and at the same time also completely exhausts all effects and influences of a particular historical event.

We all are aware that if we ask the apparently simple question such as "what is the cause of homelessness in the USA today?" we obtain all sorts of answers. Usually we will be able to discern a pattern between these answers and political opinions. Moving to a subject closer to our theme, let us ask "what are the causes of the lack of satisfaction of mathematics teaching in the public schools of the USA today, and what it its solution?"

Among the causes of this uneasiness I identify the emotions of fear and pride. I understand these emotions to operate at various levels, starting with the fear for the welfare of one's offspring \cite[p. xiii]{Wagner:2008a} to the fear of the survival of one's nation \cite<see>{NCEE:1983a}.[fn:72] The basic emotion of fear is related to the higher emotion of pride. In this situation it could be the feeling of being a good parent, the gladness of knowing that their children will be successful. And at a higher level of social aggregation, the knowledge that their nation is the greatest one on earth, the envy of all other countries.[fn:39]

It is possible to use several theoretical frameworks to perform this political discourse analysis. Personally, I would consider relevant the research and concept of the following scholars

+ Roland Barthes, Claude Lévi-Strauss - /mythology/
+ Michel Foucault - /power, knowledge, governmentality/
+ Antonio Gramsci, Chantal Mouffe - /hegemony, culture/
+ Immanuel Wallerstein - /World Systems Theory/
+ Pierre Bourdieu, Jacques Rancière - /culture, society/
+ Slavoj \v{Z}i\v{z}ek - /culture, symbols, ideology/

However, it is best not to rely on more than one theoretical framework.  While there are many overlaps there are also differences in outlook, philosophical presuppositions and methodologies that would make the use of more than one framework problematic.  While all these researchers can contribute to our political discourse analysis I consider the concepts of /governmentality/ by Michel Foucault the most productive one \cite{Dean:1999a,Burcherll:1991a,Peters:2009a,Hook:2005a}.  This approach will be discussed in the methodology chapter (Chap. 3). It may be possible to carefully and sparingly add concepts from other scholars such as from the /World Systems Theory/ of Immanuel M. \citeA{Wallerstein:2004a}.  However, I am not completely sure that would be feasible.

I would also like to make a historical comparison that I find illuminating. History does not repeat itself, but parallels and comparisons can be made that will give us some insight into a contemporary situation. In my opinion, the emotional state of the French people and as well as its government after the disaster of the Seven Years' War[fn:24] presents interesting correspondences with the contemporary United States.  I do not refer to the Vietnam War[fn:25] or even the attack of 9/11.[fn:26]  Those two disasters have never been related to the mathematical or scientific knowledge of the US population. On the contrary, the tragic loss of manufacturing jobs and the abyss of the trade deficit have been connected, among many other factors, to the perceived inadequate mathematical and scientific education in the public schools. Similarly, the technological inferiority of the French artillery and the mathematical ignorance of its artillerists was considered to be one the main causes of the humiliating defeat of France.  Other interesting historical parallels that have to bear are that both the France of the 17^th century and the USA of today were considered to be the most powerful nations on earth and that both combine great national wealth with horrendous national budget deficits.

A possible critique of my approach is the realization that any claim of causal relationship in history and sociology has to face the objection that due to the complexity of the forces in play any explanation can be sustained, and is thus in ultimate analysis meaningless. Even today we are still debating the "real" cause of the fall of the Roman Empire. In addition, any appeal to a emotions is vapid because emotions drive all human beings to perform many different actions and make many discordant choices.

I certainly agree. However, my intention is not to prove a phenomenon in a scientific, experimental sense. Rather it is to navigate through the documents of national educational policy and history of education to study the motivations, be they openly stated or uncovered by analysis, for the financial support of mathematics education.   I will attempt to understand what social, economic, military, and political conditions made those in power decide to allocate for the teaching of mathematics increasing amounts of resources.  The distribution of the national budget is a `zero sum game.'  The decision to give money to any program or agency can only occur when the discourse that supports it becomes intelligible. When certain practices, intentions, and desires become part of the public sphere to become tacitly and implicitly part of the 'normal' functioning of society.  

What will also become apparent from the analysis of the political discourse is that in parallel to the expansion of the federal share of the education budget is the centralization of the control of education.  There is a clear historical trend from local to state to federal control.  Its significance should not be underestimated because this trend contravenes the a political principle that is heartfelt among U.S. citizens, *local control* of public affairs.  We should not forget that this issue was one of the key points of contention in the U.S. Civil War.

I will use as guides some studies in education that have been done using the Foucaultian concepts of /archaeology/ and /genealogy/. Mainly \citeA{Knight:1990a} who presented their "critical appreciation of official state policies" concerning school curriculum in Australia; and Jane \citeA{Kenway:1990a} who studied how certain political forces "have all but colonized popular thinking and government policy on education in Australia." David \citeA{Blades:1997a} described and analyzed a (failed) science education reform project in Canada. More recent studies of this type in mathematics education were performed by Rong-Ji \citeA{Chen:NDa} and Thomas \citeA{Popkewitz:2004a}. However, I will make great use of research on governmentality analysis in education such as by Robert \citeA{Doherty:2006a}, Tatiana \citeA{Suspitsyna:2010a} and Roy \citeA{Goddard:2010a}.

The contributions by Pierre Bourdieu in the sociology of culture are profound.  He has extensively studied school systems \cite<e.g.>{Bourdieu:1990a}.  In an interview he stated the importance of studying schools as places where in modern societies people are build (constructed) in direct relation with their families. However, in schools also social differences are constructed and different social groups guarantee their continuation.[fn:27]

Knowledge as culture has been studied in relation to hegemony between social groups by Antonio \citeA{Gramsci:1992a} and his thoughts have been updated by Chantal Mouffe \cite{Laclau:2001a} and others. While these concepts are not directly related to my investigations, they provide useful insights into the structure of society and nations as they compete through history for hegemony or mere survival. Plato thought that knowledge of abstract ideas distinguished the rulers from the mere merchants form whom numbers where only intelligible in the context of material goods. Similarly, Antonio \citeA[4.55]{Gramsci:1992a} understood that classical, abstract knowledge was the domain of the ruling class and advocated such type of education for the lower classes as a prerequisite for participation in the affairs to the nation. Pierre Bourdieu called this type of knowledge /cultural capital/ \cite[p. 30]{Bourdieu:1990a}.

Another field of inquiry that has some relevance to my topic is national mythology. The views that citizens have about their country.  Its origin and destiny, its place among the nations and in history. About its virtues and strengths.  What is good or bad for the country.  What a citizen should aspire to and become. The theoretical framework was created by Claude Lévi-Strauss, even though his view are dated. The most highly regarded contemporary study is by Roland \citeA{Barthes:1972a} on mythology.

Finally I would like to mention the related concept by Slavoj \citeA[p. 306]{Zizek:2006a} of the "state of emergency."  Clearly, the idea of a national emergency has been advanced several times to advocate for public support of the teaching of mathematics, from the French defeat in the Seven Years' War to /A Nation at Risk/.

** COMP Significance of the Study					:sec:
#<<significance>>
This study tries to understand the reasons given for the allocation by the government of large amounts of money for mathematics education as well as the centralization of the control over the educational process. Both functions are not part of the U.S. constitution.  From the founding of the nation, education has been understood as a local activity in which parents would have preponderant if not total control. The first person known to have written on the public support of education was the Greek philosopher Plato. He presents his ideas on the instruction of children and young people in /The Republic/ (380 BCE) and /The Laws/ (355-347 BCE).[fn:8] There he affirmed the importance of the support by the state for the study of certain subjects. The justification for this financial support is that this kind of knowledge, at least among the ruling elite and military officers, is of vital national importance. Of course, it should be noted that in the Greece of that time the nation was equivalent to the city-state.[fn:43]

It should be noted that the socio-political program envisioned by /The Republic/ was never implemented in the Greek world.  It might even have been intended as an impossible allegory of what should be, but could not be.  It took many years for the idea of public support for schools to become reality.

Once this idea was accepted by society, it became more and more pervasive and it is inconceivable today to reverse its course.[fn:95] Even the most conservative of politicians, who would abolish the public school system, still advocate for some type of financial support, e.g. vouchers. All recent presidents and presidential candidates, governors and gubernatorial candidates, senators, congress members and so on, have made sweeping statements in support not only of public funding for education, but also to increase its level.  The situation today is that the funding per K-12 student in the USA is among the highest in the world \cite{OECD:2005a,OECD:2010a}.

By studying how society came to value the teaching of mathematics from total neglect to its privileged position today, I believe that we can obtain insights in the relevance of today's mathematics education and for its central place in school curricula.

It has been noticed with dismay by many that none of the many educational reforms in education in general, and in mathematical education in particular, have ameliorated the supposedly dire situation in the nation's classrooms. Many have tried to untangle the many possible reasons for these failures and a wealth of reforms, remedies, corrections, improvements, and changes have been proposed.  I certainly do not pretend to have the right answer, or even *an* answer.  I do however intend to offer this study as a means to look at the problem from a different view point. I hope that its reading may spark some insight, some original way of examining these complex issues.

Some think that the school system, especially the *public* school system is apart or above politics. That it is an impartial system where all have the same opportunities. That it is a quintessential democratic, non-elitist, and egalitarian institution.  However, many have realized that this is not the case. During an interview of Michel Foucault and Noam Chomsky,[fn:9] Foucault said the following

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
But I think that the political power is also exerted by a few other institutions which seem to have nothing in common with the political power, which seem to be independent but which actually aren't. We all know that the universities and the whole educational system that apparently are supposed to distribute knowledge, we know that the educational system maintains the power in the hands of a certain social class and exclude the other social class from this power.
#+END_QUOTE

A more extensive commentary on schools was given by Pierre Bourdieu during an interview given in 1991.[fn:10]  I translated some parts that I consider relevant to the issue of the internal achievement gap[fn:11]

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
PB: For example we can observe that the inequality in school achievement can not be completely explained by economic (financial) inequalities. Thus I had to invent a concept and call it "cultural capital."  That is the concept that we inherit from our family not only material means but also instruments of knowledge, of expression, of "savoir faire," modes and manners of work, for example, that are unconsciously transmitted by the family and that contribute enormously to the academic success.  That is because the school system requires without giving them to the students.  A simple example is work skills. I think that one for the greatest advantages of the children of intellectual categories in addition to that they hear in their families a language that is close to the language that is spoken in school, and that the school requires, is the fact that they have an attitude of relationship with culture very close to what is required in school and the fact that they receive from their families indications and encouragements concerning work and time management.  These things that apparently are of little importance, almost nothing, in reality are among the decisive factors that differentiate.  It is the art of work.  Schools give very little of this, because they do not have the time, and also because the teachers do not realize its importance.  The majority of the teachers are not aware that that is what is lacking.

This is a teachers note in the margin of a page (student essay), which is hideous even though you do not think about it.  A teacher who wrote on the margin: "scolaire" (unimaginative, unoriginal).

That means that the school system does not value what the school system itself transmits. It requires something else.  It does not consider sufficient what it gives.  
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
But if we say: this is the product of historical and social conditions such that you did not have easy access to the language that the school system requires.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We could obtain the idea that this system has intentions, that there is an evil will, a kind of evil, diabolic, perverse genie.  The worst is that these social mechanisms do not have a "will", they do not have a "subject" (des méchanismes, non des volontes). There is no conspiracy. Unfortunately one of the wrong ways to understand sociology is to transform the analysis of the mechanisms into an analysis of will.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We say "it is the dominant class that eliminates..." That is a mistake that even sociologists make and those I criticize. They say "the school eliminates." That is not true.  It is the logic of the functioning of complicated mechanisms, there exists an unconscious in those mechanisms that determines that an certain kind of children are not by chance more eliminated than others.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
School reforms fail because we look for those who are responsible, who are culpable.  In reality there are differential responsibilities that are most often responsibilities inscribed in the structures in a complicated manner that are above the capacity of the agents. That does not mean that The agents are not capable of doing something.  By becoming aware they can oppose these mechanisms, avoid to unconsciously serve them (Connaitre ce méchanisme et en enrayer l'éfficatité).
#+END_QUOTE

The effort I devote to this research project is inspired by the statement of Michel Foucault "To change something in the minds of people--that is the role of an intellectual." \cite[p. 10]{Martin:1988a}.

* COMP Literature Review						:chp:
#<<lit-review>>

# RESEARCH AG-G
A vast amount of literature exists on the achievement gaps (AG), be it on mathematics, science, or reading, national or international. However, in this chapter I will refer only to academic publications and monographs.  Public and private entities have also produced a cornucopia of journal and newspaper articles and reports.  I will consider non-academic literature a data source to be analyzed as part of my investigation (see [[data-sources][Data Sources]]). 

Part of the academic literature is about the achievement gaps in general (AG-G) and not about a specific AG type and consists either of monographs \cite<e.g.>{Chubb:2002a,Murphy:2009b,Williams:2003a}, articles \cite<e.g.>{Levitt:2004a,Murphy:2009a,White:2009a}, or reports \cite<e.g.>{Kewal:2007a}.

There are studies that have focused on the national AG in general (NAG-G) and will thus examine NAEP scores, sometimes in combination with state standardized testing \cite<e.g.>{Linton:2003a}.  Other studies were performed on the international AG (IAG-G) and analyzed TIMSS and PISA data. Examples of such reports and articles are \citeA{Schmidt:1998a} and \citeA{Wang:2001a} on mathematics and science. Tony \citeA{Wagner:2008a} recently wrote a whole monograph on the IAG and proposed some remedies (chp. 6).

# RESEARCH AG-FUNDING
However, I have not been able to find any scholarly literature on the relationship of the AG and the funding of mathematics education.  We have to realize though that (1) the majority of revenue of public schools is of local origin, and (2) this local funding is not subject specific, but rather funds the schools and school districts /in toto/.  Most of the federal funding of public education comes through Title I \cite<see>{Borman:1996a,Candal:2009a}, and some from other funding agencies such as the NSF.  

# RESEARCH AG-M
There has been considerable interest in the investigation of the cause(s) of the mathematics AG (AG-M) \cite<e.g.>{Cooper:2006a}.  Often these studies use sophisticated statistical tools such as Binary Logistic Regression \cite{Balfanz:2006a}, Multivariate Analysis \cite{Bali:2003a,Bali:2004a}, Structural Equation Modeling \cite{Borman:2002a}, complex correlation and regression \cite{Rindermann:2009a}, or Hierarchical Linear Modeling \cite{Wenglinsky:2004a}.

# ELIMINATE
Also great effort has been expended on how to eliminate, or at least narrow the mathematics AGs through instructional levers, see \citeA{Balfanz:2006a,Candal:2009a,Miranda:2007a,Holloway:2004a,Wenglinsky:2004a,Berry:2009a,Haycock:2001a,DiGisi:2005a,Nathan:1983a,Johnson:2006a,Spielhagen:2006a,Spielhagen:2006b,Beecher:2008a,Glassman:1990a,Rothman:2001a,Rumberger:1992a,Treisman:2001a,Woodward:2006a}. 

Often the researchers will admit that they disregard the study of the causes due to the complexity of the analysis and thus it would not be reasonable to base instructional instruments on such uncertain conclusions \cite<see e.g.>{Singham:2003a}.  Some studies have found, however, that little can be done to reduce the NAG using educational levers \cite{Bali:2003a}.

Other studies focused on the positive or exemplary cases.  They studied schools that were considered successful, be they in the U.S.A. or abroad and tried to distill the characteristics that made them superior \cite{Barber:2007a}. Similarly, there is a series of studies that do not focus on the reason(s) for the AGs, but rather on how to eliminate them \cite{Spielhagen:2006b}.

# INEQUALITIES, SOCIAL, POLITICAL
A subset of these studies has focused on issues of inequities as the chief cause of the AG and thus have a distinctively socio-political outlook, rather than an instructional-curricular one \cite{Braun:2006a,Carlyle:2009a,Hursh:2007a}.  In this regard, a study by Linda \citeA{Bol:2005a} is very interesting because it showed that teachers had a propensity to give more weight social factors, but that supervisors and university faculty would consider curriculum and instruction more important.

# FUNDING
Some educational researchers will discuss funding of schools \cite{Borman:1996a}. Often insufficient funding is considered to be an important cause of the AG and its increase is thus an important instrument for its resolution \cite{Apple:1992a,Jordan:2003a,Payne:1999a}. Gloria \citeA{Ladson:2007a}, who investigated funding disparity, placed this issue among larger social variables such as health and wealth and thus uses the term "gap" for all of them.  It is understandable that any analysis of funding is inherently a political discourse.

A line of educational research is concerned with funding vis-à-vis equity rather than the AG /per se/. The unequal funding of schools in the USA has been the subject of educational research and some such as \citeA{Augenblick:1997a} and Michael \citeA{Rebell:2008a} have made an oblique reference to an "educational adequacy", the emphasis has been on social justice and not the elimination of the NAG.  \cite{Augenblick:1997a,Kahle:1998a,Rebell:2008a}.  As we have seen, disparity of school funding is peculiar to the U.S.. Hence, equity is considered important in its own right as a constituent of a modern society which should be equitable.  However, it is generally accepted now that there is a strong relationship between what we could call the "funding gap" and the "achievement gap" and that low achievement is but a reflection of poor schools and it is well known that Hispanics and Afro-Americans reside disproportionately in poorer school districts. However, see \cite{Peevely:1999a} for contrasting evidence.

This line of thought is rejected by those who do not consider the cause of the AG to be due to resources, but rather to school practices \cite{Redding:1991a,Reeves:2003a,Singham:2003a}.

# BELIEFS
Another type of study is the investigation of beliefs, perspectives and attitudes of the teachers and school administrators on the AGs \cite{Bol:2005a,Carlyle:2009a}.  Even though their opinions are not based on any rigorous or critical examination of the data, they are valuable and informative \cite{Bol:2005a,Rousseau:2003a}.

# DOUBTING TESTING
Finally, some researchers seriously doubt the validity and usefulness of using standardized testing (NAEP, PISA, TIMMS) to gauge the AGs \cite{Carlyle:2009a,Rotberg:1998a}.  Others question the relationship between test scores and quality of education \cite{Chen:2010a}.

# SCHOOL REFORM
If we slightly shift our gaze from the AGs to a closely related issue, namely school reform, then we encounter some very interesting political analyses. For instance an incisive critique was presented by David \citeA[p. xiii]{Gabbard:2000a} who wrote

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
To challenge the belief that a people's economic development proceeds in direct proportion to their level of educational achievement poses a threat of heresy against one of the most fundamental principles in modern secular theology. Precisely because education and development each implies a process resulting in some form of favorable change, we may properly speak of them as separate values. However, whereas education has a history of conceptual evolution separate from that of development, their evolutionary paths have since merged and congealed into one of the great and sacred certainties of our era. Nowhere, perhaps, has this belief taken stronger hold than in the United States, where the educational reform initiatives of the 1980s and 1990s have now elevated this belief to canonical status.
#+END_QUOTE

He continued his incisive critique with

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
At least two approaches present themselves for casting doubt on this sacred truism. The first entails an inquiry into the truthfulness of the claim. Since the National Commission on Excellence in Education released /A Nation at Risk/ in 1983, corporate elites and elected officials have orchestrated a massive propaganda campaign aimed at convincing the public that schools are, at once, the cause and the cure for their economic insecurity. In typical fashion, the media very obediently assisted in facilitating this fraud, helping to further entrench the belief that a people's economic development proceeds in direct proportion to their level of educational achievement. Not only has the media helped to spread this secular theology, it has also protected it from any serious public scrutiny by failing to report any of the most elementary facts that would call its presuppositions to question.[fn:98]
#+END_QUOTE

Gerald \citeA{Bracey:2003c} published an analysis that were very similar to Gabbard's. In the same book, Thomas \citeA{Popkewitz:2000a} provided discussion of school reform according to a Foucaultian prospective, Karen \citeA{Barnhardt:2000a} discussed the idea of "crisis" in US politics and culture, and Steve \citeA{Tozer:2000a} the concept of class that I find useful in my data analysis.  Seymour \citeA{Sarason:2003a} has also pointed out the "intractability of school reform" in his anthology. For instance he wrote (2003, p. 252)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
When over a period of time a condition has been intractable to efforts to improve it, it is a sure-fire sign that something is radically wrong with the assumptions on which our actions are based.
#+END_QUOTE

As I have shown previously ([[rationale][Rationale]]) and will discuss more extensively later (in the dissertation itself), rarely is the concept of class or income gap used.  However, some researchers have investigated the instructional situation of poor students \cite<see e.g.>{Mertens:2003a,Bracey:2002a}. 

# SCHOOL POLICY AND PHILOSOPHY
Finally, there are studies that approach the subject from a more distant viewpoint that are helpful in my investigations \cite<see e.g.>{Valero:2004a}. For instance, Joseph \citeA{Dunne:2005a} who wrote a chapter in \citeA{Carr:2005a} entitled "What's good of education?".  Joe \citeA{Kincheloe:1999a} wrote a political analysis describing how in U.S. workers made to be part of the economic systems through a variety of institutions, among which are the public schools and more specifically vocational schools. Jonathan \citeA{Kozol:1991a,Kozol:2006a} has written very critically about the public school system. Gloria \citeA{Ladson:2006a} discussed the AG and argued that we should instead focus on what she named the "education debt".  Kristi \citeA{Garrett:2009a} recently wrote that to really close the AGs it is imperative to talk about race.

Some researchers have done what I intend to do, that is the "problematization of the problematization" of the AGs \cite<see e.g.>{Martin:2003a,Bracey:1998a,Bracey:2003a,Bracey:2003b,Bracey:2003c}.  

Sometimes even those who only invoke the use of instructional tools will have to engage in political discourse.  For instance, often Charter Schools are presented as a solution because they offer instructional flexibility and can thus, according to their proponents, adapt to the needs of low-achieving students \cite{Nathan:1983a}.  Evidently, support of charter schools is a political stance.  Some, less trusting, scholars have stated that an appeal to educational changes is but a thinly veiled disguise for a political agenda be it more "liberal" or "conservative" \cite{Bracey:2003c}.

# POLITICO-SOCIAL knowledge/teaching mathematics 
Another interesting field of study in mathematics education is the politico-social function of the knowledge of mathematics and the drives in teaching it \cite{Namukasa:2004a,Walshaw:2004a}.  In the examination of the political dimensions of mathematics education I find very useful the use of a concept introduced by Michel Foucault called /governmentality/.  I will write later in more detail about it (see [[methodology][Methodology]]).  There are a few researchers who have used this concept in education research such as Robert \citeA{Doherty:2006a}, \citeA{Peters:2009a}, and \citeA{Popkewitz:2007a}.

* COMP Research Questions						:chp:
#<<res-questions>>
Here I would like to condense the previous discussion about the political discourse on mathematics education vis-à-vis the achievement gaps into narrowly defined research questions.  The purpose for this process is to guide, to focus, and structure the process of investigation.  Hence, I have developed the following research questions

1. What kinds of insights and understandings do the concepts of governmentality of Foucault give us in the analysis of the discourses of political structures and organizations, educational organizations, businesses and their organizations, think tanks, and the military?

2. How have politicians described their motivations to centralize more and more local policy control in the teaching of mathematics?  What are the means, speeches, press releases, addresses to the nation and to meetings?  What kind of language is used?  To what type of logic and emotions do they appeal?

3. What has been the role of the mathematicians and mathematics teachers themselves in the process of national educational policy?  How they have spoken and written to authorities and the literates of their society, first as individuals, then as members of professional societies and other organizations?

4. What is the role of large corporations as well as commercial organizations in encouraging financial support and policy control? How do they communicate their fears or aspirations? What is their logic, what do they appeal to?  To whom do they communicate, and how do they differentiate their discourse based on their audience?

5. Similarly to the previous entities, what is the role of the military in fostering the financial support and policy control of mathematics education? Has their discourse changed over time or has it been fairly constant?

6. How has the attitude towards the political control at the national level of the teaching of mathematics changed from neglect to the high level of involvement of today?  What are (some of) the discontinuities in the history of ideas? How can these pivotal points be related to the economic, cultural, political, and military situation in that time and place?

In the [[ans-res-quest][Answering the Research Questions]] section of the [[methodology][Methodology]] chapter I will provide the means for answering these research questions.

* COMP Methodology							:chp:
#<<methodology>>

** COMP Introduction							:sec:
#<<method-intro>>
In this chapter I describe how I intend to answer the [[res-questions][research questions]]. In the [[method-intro][Introduction]] section I will briefly describe the theoretical principles used to frame these questions. Then in the [[analysis-methods][Analysis Methods]] section I give a description of the qualitative and quantitative analysis methods used answer the research questions by analyzing the data sources. In this section I will also present the software tools.  The section is followed with the [[data-sources][Data Sources]] section where I explaining how the data sources were selected. I tabulated the data sources and point to the appendices A.1 to A.8 where they are listed in detail. Then I describe the research work flow from a more operational point of view. The chapter will be concluded by an examination how the previously described methods, principles and data sources will enable us to [[ans-res-quest][answer the Research Questions]].

\citeA{Gough:2000a} describes /methodology/ as the "reasoning that informs particular ways of doing research, or the principles that inform the organization of research activity" and also as "conceptual framework or the assumptions that guide their research" and "reasons for using such techniques in relation to the kind of knowledge or understanding the researcher is seeking."  Similarly, \citeA[p. 38]{Rudestam:2007a} stated that "methodologies can be regarded as the strategies, action plans, or designs that inform the choice of specific methods, that is, procedures and techniques for data collection and analysis."

# difference methods and methodology
While often `method' and `methodology' are confused or used synonymously, Harding (as cited in \citeNP{Gough:2000a}) stated that in the social sciences

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A research /method/ is a technique for (or a way of proceeding in) gathering evidence.  One could reasonable argue that all-evidence gathering techniques fall into one of the following three categories: *listening to (or interrogating) informants*, *observing behaviour*, or *examining historical traces and records*.  In this sense, there are only three methods of social inquiry.[fn:35]
#+END_QUOTE

Briefly stated, my study is an archival-historical research project. Thus, obviously, in my case the only method that will be used is the third one, /examining historical traces and records/. I will call it /text analysis/ with the understanding that I am mostly examining written texts, which I may supplement with some audiovisual material. These /historical traces and records/ are my *data*. The kind of documents and their sources are presented in the section [[data-sources][Data Sources]].  This qualitative analysis will be complemented by quantitative text analysis, also called /text mining/.

The research project could be understood as a hermeneutical study. Hermeneutics is the discipline that attempts to discover the meaning of a text. However, the object of study is not a text or even a corpus of texts.  The object of study is the discourse of a body politic, the U.S. government.  The meaning of the texts is certainly important and has to be taken into consideration, but it is not the focus of the study.

The study of social perceptions as evinced from public statements is clearly a study not of "objects" and not even of "behaviour," but of ideas and of discourses. Whether a statement itself is true or not is not the issue, and even its meaning defined as intent of the original author is only secondarily relevant. I am interested in understanding what counts and what does not, what is perceived as correct and what is not. However, I intend to go beyond this.  I also want to study what is not said, what is missing, or more precisely, what does not have to be said. This is the domain of "discourse analysis," especially the types of discourse analysis developed by Michel Foucault \citeA[pp. 871--872]{Perakyla:2005a}. 

Why have I chosen Foucault's among the many approaches that are available to engage in the analysis of educational policy?  To answer this question we need to recall that in qualitative studies the researcher is his or her own instrument.  The researcher's attitudes, opinions and world view are greatly influenced by the environment he or she grew up in and the emotional and intellectual experiences of life.  I have due to family history changed many times myself.  I have changed the language in which I think several times, I have changed political and religious outlooks, I have changed diet. I have even changed from being left-handed to right-handed.  Hence it comes natural to me to agree with the following statement by Mark \citeA[p. ]{Olssen:1999a}

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Critique, for Foucault, aims at identifying and exposing the unrecognized forms of power in people's lives, to expose and move beyond the forms in which we are entrapped in relation to the diverse ways that we act and think.  In this sense, critique aims to free us from the historically transitory constraints of contemporary consciousness as realized in and through discursive practices. Such constraints impose limitations that have become so intimately a part of the way people experience their lives that they no longer experience these systems as limitations but embrace them as the very structure of normal and natural human behavior.  Within these limits, seen as both the limits of reason and the limits of nature, freedom is subordinated to reason which is subordinated to nature, and it is against such a reduction of reason to nature that Foucault struggles.  His commitment is to a form of "permanent criticism" which much be seen as linked to his broader program of freedom of thought.  It is the freedom to think differently from what we already know.
#+END_QUOTE

I find it easier to discuss my methodology by starting with the methods that I have chosen.  The type of research determines the methods. The methods of an archival-historical project are text and discourse analysis.  I will examine statements by politicians, political and professional organizations, corporations and think tanks.  These statements are in the form of reports, press releases, web articles and quotations and interviews by journalists of the above mentioned entities. The medium will be printed or electronic.  The form will be written or video.  In the case of spoken statements I will prepare transcripts.

# scrivere di piu' su "governmentality" come metodologia
#
My paradigmatic standpoint in this research project is eminently qualitative. However, I will also use some quantitative methods as a supplementary investigation as it is now possible to do statistical analysis of texts. I briefly describe this type of analysis below in [[quant-analysis][Quantitative Analysis]].

At this point I would like to briefly touch the issue of ethics in educational research.  There is a branch of philosophy that studies values \cite{Gough:2000a}, and ethics \cite[p. 183]{Denzin:2005a}. Ethical considerations are never far away in the natural sciences. Consider for example research in genetics, medicine, nuclear energy, artificial intelligence, or robotics.  In the social sciences the situation is complex. We have positivist social scientists that claim that their research process is value-neutral \cite<e.g.>[Tables 8.2-4]{Guba:2005a}.  This is strongly disputed by social researchers that do not accept the positivist view of their research \cite{Howe:2009a}. It is impossible to do social research and not be concerned about values.  Kenneth \citeA{Howe:2009a} stated "Just as social research is theory-laden, it is also value-laden."  It is inescapable. After all, the statement "my research is value-neutral" is a value statement.

What is my position?   I certainly join those who state that any type of investigation has ethical implications. However, I do not intend to espouse any activist orientation. I do not espouse any particular action in educational research or policy in this investigation.  This research will undoubtedly inform, shape, and even change my personal opinions on education and its policies, but I do not want that to be an integral part of my present studies.  From an operational, methodological position, my work will follow the /Standards for reporting on humanities-oriented research in AERA publications/ \cite{Barone:2009a}.

Having said that, I want to state that I completely agree with \citeA[p. 200]{Guba:2005a} that axiology is "part of the foundational philosophical dimensions of paradigm proposal."  My work intends to assist, even in small measure, the reader to recognize in mathematics education what Pierre Bourdieu calls /symbolic violence/ \cite{Sabour:1999a}, that the knowledge it produces is a product to be sold \cite[p. 4]{Lyotard:1984a}, and that what appears to be natural, normal, a fact of life, is actually a socially inculcated way of thinking. Thus, we can reclaim some of our freedom of action.

** COMP Analysis Methods						:sec:
#<<analysis-methods>>
I intend to avail myself of both qualitative and quantitative investigations. Why both? Because the analysis process will consist of two tracks that are parallel, but also intertwined and reinforcing, correcting, and informing each other.  It may be pictorially imagined as a caduceus, a symbol of balanced and equal exchange.  These two approaches are thus qualitative discourse analysis and statistical text analysis, also called text-mining.

The next two sections describe in some detail the qualitative and quantitative analysis methods that I intend to avail myself of.

*** Qualitative Analysis
#<<qual-analysis>>

The analysis of qualitative data (QDA) as a strategy, activity, and set of methods is varied, but can be conceptually reduced to a series of processes.  Here I will rely on the description given by John \citeA[pp. 150--155]{Creswell:2007a} of these processes that he calls collectively the "Data Analysis Spiral"

In quantitative analysis there is a clear, linear process from experimental design, through data collection, to statistical analysis, and then discussion and conclusions.  Qualitative analysis is not linear, but can be imagined as a combination of a line with a circle, obtaining a spiral.  The process is iterative, but at each turn the analysis has progressed.  At many steps of our analysis we have to look back at the data to modify our initial analysis, the analysis then modifies our understandings, which will then modify, shift our analytical framework, until at the end he have obtained an account or a narrative.

The first circles are about /data management/, where the researchers collect and organize their data sources, and performs the appropriate conversions and classifications.  The researchers will often group the material into categories (in my case: bills, hearings, speeches, etc) as well as giving attributes to the files (e.g. date, location, author, affiliation of the author, etc.).

This is followed by the /reading and memoing/ of the data, where the researchers familiarize themselves with the data by extensive reading and comparisons within the data and with the existing literature.  Often the researcher will write notes and memos and other types of comments.

The next group of loops are the core of the qualitative analysis process.  These cycles are devoted to /description, classification, and interpretation/ of the data.   The researcher will create codes, also called categories, These codes are then applied to portions of the text.  There are no precise boundaries to these codes texts.  They range from fragments of sentences to one or more paragraphs.  The number of codes also varies, often new codes are created and other are discarded during this process due to the iterative nature of qualitative analysis.  During this stage of analysis the researchers can now go "beyond" the text.  They can notice and mark dichotomies, omissions, disruptions, metaphors, allusions, and contradictions. At a later stage related codes can be grouped into themes.  At this point the researchers will begin to interpret the data.  This is a very personal and "fuzzy" process and often these interpretations will be tentative and inconclusive \cite<see>[p. 154]{Creswell:2007a}.

The final phase of this analysis spiral the researchers will present their findings.  This can be done in textual, tabular, and graphical form.  Usually the report or paper will contain a mixture of these three representations.  The final product may be in the form of a narrative, a hypothesis, or a set of propositions. Again, often a melange of these forms.

Even though all these steps can be performed using pencil and paper and have been done in this fashion until recent, the use of software and computers can greatly facilitate this process.  There is a category of software called "qualitative data analysis" (QDA). There are several QDA packages, both commercial and open source.  For ideological and practical reasons I have decided to use /R/ an open source data analysis system \cite{R-project:2010a}.[fn:115] /R/ is free, multi-platform (Windows, MacOSX, UNIX/Linux), actively developed and thus frequently updated, it possesses many, many additional libraries for just about any possible statistical and data analysis application, and is very popular in academia.  On the downside, the system is somewhat difficult to use and is not as popular among social scientists as it is among statisticians and researchers in the natural sciences.  Among the many add-on libraries is /RQDA/.[fn:116]  From the website

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
RQDA is an easy-to-use tool to assist in the analysis of textual data. At the present, it supports only plain text format data. (....) It includes a number of standard Computer-Aided Qualitative Data Analysis features. Besides, it seamlessly integrated with R, which means that a) statistical analysis on the coding is possible, and b) functions about data manipulation and analysis can be easily extended by writing R functions. To some extent, RQDA and R makes an integrated platform for both quantitative and qualitative data analysis.
#+END_QUOTE

As can be read here below, I will also use /R/ for quantitative data analysis.

*** Quantitative Analysis
#<<quant-analysis>>

What can a quantitative analysis provide to a study in educational policy?  Among the advantages is the capacity of analyzing *large* amounts of text.  Another positive aspect is the automated analysis.  Human judgement, distraction, mistakes, and biases do not play a part in coding and extraction of information.  \citeA{Monroe:2008a} discussed the use of statistical analysis of political texts, their advantages and their limitations. This kind of analysis is commonly called /text mining/.  Recently \citeA{Graesser:2011a} have stated

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Automated analysis of the language and discourse characteristics of texts have enormous practical value in education, in addition to advancing scientific theories of reading and comprehension.
#+END_QUOTE

We have to bear in mind that if in social sciences we intend to perform a quantitative study we are restricted to a relatively small set of data that are numeric or can be converted into a numeric form.  The reality is that the vast majority of data that social scientists are interested in are in text form and thus beyond the reach of a quantitative analysis.  The possibility of somehow obtaining, abstracting, or extracting information of this large repository of data can be of great value.

There are many statistical packages capable of performing text mining that one can choose from, both commercial and open source.  As for my QDA I have for  practical and ideological reasons I have again chosen the open source /R/ data analysis application \cite{R-project:2010a}.[fn:76]  

The main statistical analyses of text mining done by /R/ are /count-based evaluation/, /term correlations/, /simple text clustering/, /hierarchical clustering/, /trend analysis/ and /text classification/.  One can consult \citeA{Feinerer:2008a,Feinerer:2008b,Feinerer:2008c} for an explanation of these terms as well as for examples of this type of analysis performed in the /R/ data analysis application \cite{Feinerer:2010a}.

For computationally intensive tasks I will use /Brazos/ a major computing cluster (HPC) at Texas A&M University.[fn:114]  The Brazos is a cluster of 126 Dell PowerEdge 1950 1U servers and runs the Linux operating system.  It supports several scientific and mathematical programs, among which /R/.

** COMP Data Sources							:sec:
#<<data-sources>>
Because the focus of this research is the study of the national educational policy I have chosen to study documents produced by the legislative and executive branches of the U.S. government.  Material pertaining to the first branch are hearing, bills, and congressional documents. From the second branch I have selected presidential documents and material prepared by the U.S. Department of Education.  In addition I have obtained a set of documents from the ERIC collection.  In addition I will look at a set of very influential non-governmental publications that have often been cited and referred to in the Congressional documents.  At the end I will look at documents (reports) prepared by two international organizations.  The first one is the  Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD),[fn:111] which manages the /Programme for International Student Assessment/.[fn:112]  The second one is The International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement(IEA),[fn:113] which manages the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study/ (1995, 1999, 2003, 2007).

The main source for government documents was the U.S. Government Printing Office Federal Digital System (http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys).  I performed searches among several of the collections for the keywords "education", "math", and "achievement gap".[fn:108] Table \ref{tbl:sources} shows the searches and results obtained and the appendices where details are provided.  I added to those collection several documents prepared by ERIC, the U.S. Department of Education that were selected by searching for mathematics and achievement gap.  In addition, I collected several documents prepared by influential Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs) on the subject of the achievement gap. I made sure to include documents that the Congressional hearings were referring to.  Finally, I added relevant PISA and TIMMS documents and statement from the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) on the achievement gap.

** COMP Research work flow						:sec:
#<<work-flow>>
In this section I describe operationally the work flow from obtaining the data sources to the production of the final synthesis of the results of the qualitative and quantitative data analyses. The investigative work flow is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:workflow}. The preparatory steps are in green, the qualitative analysis in red, and the quantitative one in blue. I have shown with double arrows the interactive nature of both types of analytical processes.

#+CAPTION: Flow diagram of the research process
#+LABEL: fig:workflow
#+ATTR_LaTeX: width=12cm
[[/home/henk/Dropbox/dissertation/workflow.jpg]]

The first operation is the downloading of the source files which is performed by UNIX scripts (see Appendices A.9.1 to A.9.5). This is followed by the conversion of the HTML and pdf files into plain text files.  These processes are performed by the same UNIX scripts that downloaded the files. The following procedures are only applicable to the congressional hearings and bills.

The hearing documents provide the transcript of interviews and the reading of statements of witnesses and committee members.  However, all the statements, both read and unread, are provided again at the end of the document.  Thus the read statements will appear twice in the hearing document.

In the case of the congressional bills, the same document is present during its various stages of congressional discussion and approval. Often these documents are amended or otherwise slightly modified.  Furthermore, I am only interested in the discursive sections of the bills, usually titled "Purpose", "Findings", or "Policy".  Thus, I intend to only have one representative document of the same law and to extract the relevant sections from the congressional bills. I intend to create UNIX scripts that would perform these actions. 

The next step is the transfer of the plain text files into RQDA, the QDA software.  This is more easily performed by using an /R/ script (see Appendix A.10.1).  At this point the `real' QDA commences.  I will apply to relevant paragraph the appropriate codes as described in the section [[qual-analysis][Qualitative analysis]]. I would also like to explore the possibility of automatizing, at least partially, the application of these codes based on key words and key word groups by writing /R/ scripts.

In addition to the coding of the paragraphs it is useful to give several attributes to each of the files, such as "author", "time stamp", "document type", "institutional affiliation", "political affiliation" and so on.  This will help with the construction of time line diagrams and other types of analyses. It is possible to write /R/ scripts to automatically populate these file attributes. For the other QDA processes please refer to the [[qual-analysis][Qualitative Analysis]] section.

Once the application of file attributes is complete we can export the text files from RQDA into /tm/.  This again is accomplished by an /R/ script (see Appendix A.10.2).  At this point the text needs to be pre-processed.  This procedure involves the removal of low-content words, punctuation, and numbers. In addition all text is changed into lower case.  I have added to this stage the removal of additional low-content words based on pilot studies. Furthermore I will reduce synonyms and hyphenated and not hyphenated word groups to single terms.  As mentioned previously, all these analyses are quite interactive.  Results will prompt the modification of the procedures that obtained them.  This type of approach is very different from classical quantitative analysis where we proceed linearly and uni-directionally from hypothesis to experimental design, experiment, and data analysis.  The script that performs pre-processing (see Appendix A.10.3) is run on the /Brazos/ cluster due to its computational intensity.

Once the text is pre-processed the `real' text mining is performed as described in section [[quant-analysis][Quantitative Analysis]]. The process will yield several tables, plots (e.g. dengrograms) and diagrams (e.g. word clouds and directed and undirected graphs).  Some complex analyses will have to be run on the /Brazos/ cluster.

The final stage is the synthesis of both types of analysis, which will result in development of material to write the discussion and conclusion chapters.
  
** COMP Answering the Research Questions				:sec:
#<<ans-res-quest>>
I would like to conclude the Methodology chapter by explaining how the previously discussed methods, methodological principles, and data sources will enable us to answer the research questions.  I will here repeat the questions and then outline my initial approach to answering them.  We have to remember that in qualitative research the approach is not linear but in spiral form.  The researchers will often revise their initial assumptions and modify their approach in light of the insights obtained during the investigative process.

*** Question 1
/What kinds of insights and understandings do the concepts of governmentality of Foucault give us in the analysis of the discourses of political structures and organizations, educational organizations, businesses and their organizations, think tanks, and the military?/

This is a preliminary question of this investigation, and the most theoretical one of the six research questions.  Here I base myself on the research and understanding of educational researchers that have used the Foucaultian concept of /governmentality/.  I am referring primarily to Roy \citeA{Goddard:2010a}, Robert \citeA{Doherty:2006a}, Ian \citeA{Hunter:1996a}, \citeA{Peters:2009a}, Donald \citeA{Gillies:2008a}, Brenda \citeA{Spencer:2001a}, Michael \citeA{Peters:2007a}, Jie \citeA{Qi:1997a}, \citeA{Graham:2004a}, and Tatiana \citeA{Suspitsyna:2010a}.

First of all, the Foucaultian concepts of /governmentality/ and /genealogy/ sensitize those who analyze political documents.  We are made aware of the /technologies/ of power, we understand that e.g. standardization, certification, testing, and accountability are means for the state/nation to manage its human resources within the framework of a neoliberalist ideal.  It allows the reader to go beyond the surface of the discourse and discern deeper currents, i.e. sub-texts.  The Foucaultian stance in a certain sense neither takes data at is face value, nor does it attempt to intervene, or somehow correct a situation that is deemed to be improvable.  Thus, it allows the researcher to look in more focused way at how the situation is and how it became thus.

Summarizing, Question 1 is more accurately to be understood as a /meta-question/.  It should be constantly asked while the data is analyzed and the narrative is developed. It hones and focuses the analyses that will be applied to Questions 2 to 6.  There is a price to be paid, however. We are choosing one approach for the analysis over other possible ones, such as rhetorical, critical, or neo-gramscian approaches.  Such is the nature of any investigation and is unavoidable.  Qualitative analysis may have an edge over quantitative analysis due to the fact that there is no rigid research hypothesis to confirm or to reject, as well the iterative, self-adjusting nature of qualitative research. Nonetheless, all research has to acknowledge its limitations and blind spots.

*** Question 2
/How have politicians described their motivations to centralize more and more local policy control in the teaching of mathematics?  What are the means, speeches, press releases, addresses to the nation and to meetings?  What kind of language is used?  To what type of logic and emotions do they appeal?/

The centralization of political power from the periphery to the center has been an ongoing phenomenon since the founding of the nation.  We could cite as milestones the creation of the Office of Education first (1868), its conversion into U.S. Department of Education (1953), the extension of applicability of the /Commerce Clause/ and the /Taxing and Spending Clause/, the consequences of /Brown versus Board of Education/, and so on.  

To answer this question I would create relevant codes (e.g. "centralize", "national-interest", "equity", "all-students", "de-segreation") and attributes ("time-stamp", "author", affiliation," etc.).  I would them summarize and abstract these marked text under the appropriate theme (e.g. "central-control") and to create a pictorial representation and narrative of the phenomenon.

*** Question 3
/What has been the role of the mathematicians and mathematics teachers themselves in the process of national educational policy?  How they have spoken and written to authorities and the literates of their society, first as individuals, then as members of professional societies and other organizations?/

I propose two starting points for this part of the investigation.  The first one starts from the policy statements of the NCTM, and the second one from those Congressional Hearings where members of NCTM, mathematics educators and mathematics education faculty have made presentations and have answered questions.  Again, I will create appropriate codes and attributes to be condensed into one theme.  I will look for and mark statements that point to specific requests and concerns of the mathematics educators.  I will try to perceive repetitions, recurring phraseologies, appeals to preexisting events and other statements.  I will also look for unanswered questions, evasion, and for extraneous, volunteered statements that are not in answer to any question and may even be off topic.

The analysis process of their contribution can detect whether statements by politicians have echoed mathematics educators statements, or changed them, or even ignored them in favor of different/competing voices such as business exponents or educational testing and publishing companies.  It will be useful to place these statements on a time line and to add to this line significant events such as the introduction or passing of certain bills, the release of statements, and so on.  It may be possible to have a graphical representation of the back and forth exchange of ideas between centers of opinion.

*** Question 4
/What is the role of large corporations as well as commercial organizations in encouraging financial support and policy control? How do they communicate their fears or aspirations? What is their logic, what do they appeal to?  To whom do they communicate, and how do they differentiate their discourse based on their audience?/

The process of answering this question is very similar to the preceding one. I will create appropriate codes and attributes that would have to applied to the data sources.  Again, I will have to detect and mark allusions, references, repetitions and alterations, and omissions of concepts, certain phraseologies, catch phrases, slogan, and reasonings. I will pay special attention to unrequested comments and statements. These coded passages will then be abstracted into a narrative and representations.

*** Question 5
/Similarly to the previous entities, what is the role of the military in fostering the financial support and policy control of mathematics education? Has their discourse changed over time or has it been fairly constant?/

My preliminary examination of the data has shown little military involvement in the policy discourse on mathematics education.  Today we do not have the level of open statements on education as previously with U.S. Navy Admiral Hyman \citeA{Rickover:1963a}.  I may have to conclude that this question not be explored at this point.  I will try to notice, however, allusions to national security and national defense in the statements by members of the Congress and the Executive to see whether they can be made part of the narrative.  The economic and the military aspects of national politics are distinct but never too far from each other. We should bear in mind that the DoD is actively involved in education internally under the heading of training.  The military are actually quite interested in exploring advanced educational strategies such as artificial intelligence tutoring systems.[fn:28]  In addition the Office of Naval Research and others offices support academic research in education.

*** Question 6
/How has the attitude towards the political control at the national level of the teaching of mathematics changed from neglect to the high level of involvement of today?  What are (some of) the discontinuities in the history of ideas? How can these pivotal points be related to the economic, cultural, political, and military situation in that time and place?/

This question can not be answered in a satisfactory manner using the data sources I have. The time frame that they span is too narrow.  However, my cursory examination of the documents has shown a clear preponderance of statements on state and local control at the beginning of the time frame. Then this shifts to voluntary national standards, reaching at the end of the span of time to national and uniform standards and educational policy.  By placing these statements on a time line, doing frequency counts and calculating ratios of opposing statements it may very well be possible to discern a trend in centralization.

[fn:66] Exceptions known to me are Philistia and Normandy.  The conquering Philistines and Vikings took the language of the conquered.  This probably happened because the invaders were mainly males who married local women.  The mothers would teach their own language to their children.  By the time that the Normans invaded England they spoke French and not Danish.  All Philistine inscriptions found are in Canaaitic, not Greek. Sometimes the conquerors do not want the conquered to speak the language of the winners to keep them at a disadvantage.   See again the Normans in England.  Sometimes the élite would speak a foreign language for the same reason.  For instance, the Russian nobility would speak French so that their Russian subject would not understand them.

[fn:80] What is meant here is that mathematics has no cultural or ethnic barriers.  It does create again an inside-outside bifurcation which has profound financial and social implications.  It creates a sort of /intellectual nobility/ that mostly replaces the previous /blood nobility/.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The error was just as if some one who wanted to divide the human race, were to divide them after the fashion which prevails in this part of the world; here they cut off the Hellenes as one species, and all the other species of mankind, which are innumerable, and have no ties or common language, they include under the single name of "barbarians," and because they have one name they are supposed to be of one species also. Or suppose that in dividing numbers you were to cut off ten thousand from all the rest, and make of it one species, comprehending the first under another separate name, you might say that here too was a single class, because you had given it a single name. Whereas you would make a much better and more equal and logical classification of numbers, if you divided them into odd and even; or of the human species, if you divided them into male and female; and only separated off Lydians or Phrygians, or any other tribe, and arrayed them against the rest of the world, when you could no longer make a division into parts which were also classes.

[fn:90] I am not arguing here whether the USA is a classless society or not. I do think that it is in all societies be they technologically advanced or primitive, capitalist or communist, but that is not my point here.  I take the myth at face value. A significant proportion of the population in the USA thinks that it is, or in any case it is part and parcel of the dominant political and cultural discourse in the country.  Any perfunctory examination of election campaign material will quickly detect this.  One of the sobering aspects of the Katrina has been that it has shown the myth of the classless society for what it is, a vague collective desire at best and a cruel farce at worst.

   http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/ERIC-ED466828/pdf/ERIC-ED466828.pdf

   A study examined alternatives to retention or social promotion. Chapter 1 considers the short-term and long-term consequences of each alternative and concludes that neither improves declining graduation rates, declining ability to meet employer requirements, or the achievement gap between white students and students of color. Chapter 2 recommends standards- driven reform that includes effective and nonpunitive assessment. Chapter 3 suggests that prevention and early intervention, through quality preschool education, are preferable to remediation. Chapter 4 emphasizes flexibility in structuring curriculum, instructional practices, and classroom time so that every student continually engages in learning and receives appropriate interventions. Chapter 5 recommends an alignment of student and teaching standards, with a strategy at state and district levels to attract, train, and keep effective schoolteachers. Chapter 6 states that schools should never give up on students at any point in their education, though special attention should be given to the first year of middle school and high school. Each chapter has a summary of suggested state policies and actions. Sidebars give real-world examples of effective schools or programs. An appendix summarizes successes in standards-based reform in North Carolina, Texas, and Connecticut. (Contains 131 references.).

   This year marks the seventh edition of the "Summary of State Student Assessment Programs (SSAP) and the third year that the Council of Chief State School Officers has conducted the survey on which the summary is based on its own. The survey summarizes what is happening in statewide assessment programs and provides information on trends in state assessment activities. In the Data Volumes each question in the survey yields at least one data table. Data in the two volumes provide information on the status of, and trends in, state assessment policy and practice. Volume I contains these sections: (1) "SSAP Survey Instruction for 1998-1999"; (2) "Summary Table"; (3) "State Assessment Directors, May 2001"; and (4) "Data Tables." The fourth section, only part of which is in Volume I, contains information on the program overview, special topics, and program components. The balance of the fourth section is in Volume 2. Volume 2 contains the following sections: (1) "Program Components"; (2) "Performance Standards"; (3) "Students with Disabilities, Exemptions, and Accommodations"; and (5) "Assessment Results Reporting." The numerous questions from the survey are accompanied by many tables.

   http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/ERIC-ED463565/pdf/ERIC-ED463565.pdf

   This report proposes that not enough good data or research has been done to settle the debate over whether testing affects high school dropout rates. Advocates argue that the threat of missing out on a diploma or of being retained motivates students to work harder, resulting in higher academic achievement. Critics argue that failing a high school exam, being retained, or anticipating such failure can push students over the academic edge, causing them to quit school. Problems with understanding the dropout issue include inconsistencies with how dropouts are defined and reported. Testing produces information that is limited in both scope and analytical methodology. While some studies suggest broad reasons for dropping out, such as not liking school or not getting along with teachers, no causal connection has been revealed between any single factor and the decision to quit school. The report recommends that negative unintended consequences of high-stakes test programs be disclosed, that keeping accurate dropout data is important, and that states allow a fair phase-in program to allow for alignment of curriculum, teaching practice, and assessment. Research recommendations include doing more credible and extensive data collection, and implementing more longitudinal studies and causal research. (Contains 38 references.).

   This study examined how five high-poverty Texas high schools, which had attained notable achievement levels on selected academic indicators, reached their present levels of performance. The schools shared several characteristics: most students were economically disadvantaged; the location was in a large urban district; there was no selective admission; they had a Texas accountability rating of acceptable, recognized, or exemplary; and student achievement on at least one of three academic indicators was higher than the state average (the Texas Learning Index, the Algebra I End-of-Course Examination, or Advanced Placement enrollment and course offerings). Study data came from observations, documents, and interviews with administrators, teachers, school staff, students, parents, and district administrators. Results found that despite commonalities, each school implemented its practices in unique ways. Practices that were critical to high performance included setting clear goals and establishing high expectations, using data to guide instruction, focusing on instruction and individual learning, supporting teachers and enhancing collaboration, and fostering an environment of respect and affection for students.

    This report provides information about how states identify schools that are not performing at expected levels and what some states have done to provide assistance in the improvement of these schools. Kentucky, North Carolina, and South Carolina share similarities in their approaches in that they spent time and effort in preparatory activities, developed comprehensive student testing systems that are highly correlated with state curriculum goals, and adopted a more rigorous standard of student performance than had been required under their previous testing systems. None rely exclusively on test scores for assessing schools. All schools rely on the expertise of educators from outside the low-performing school's home district to bring about improvements. All emphasize local capacity building as a primary ingredient in helping low-performing schools become successful. Policymakers need to be clear about the goals they set for school improvement, need to provide time for schools to bring about significant improvements, and support staff development. They can create strategies at the state, local, and school levels for bringing about school improvement, should recognize the value--but insufficiency--of short-term success, and recognize that school success rests on the power and skill of educators.

    This fourth annual study reports on state practices in 1999-2000 concerning reporting on the participation and performance of students with disabilities in statewide assessments. Unlike previous reports, the unit of analysis was the state assessments rather than all publicly available print reports. The report describes the assessment systems used in each state and whether the state publicly reports participation and performance for students with disabilities on each test. It also provides participation data when available and data on the performance gap between students wit,h disabilities and the'total population. Only 16 states reported participation and performance results for students with disabilities on all of their tests, although 15 additional states provided this data for some tests. Most states that reported disaggregated performance results also reported disaggregated participation results. Six recommendations include: (1) provide data no more than 6 months after test administration; (2) establish reporting practices consistent with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act; and (3) report the number and percent of students with disabilities using accommodations. Appendices provide the sample verification table and disaggregated participation information.

    In 1999, the United States Department of Education's Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI) asked RAND to examine how OERI might improve the quality and relevance of the education research it funds. The RAND Reading Study Group (RRSG) was charged with developing a research framework to address the most pressing issues in literacy. The RRSG focused on the highest priorities for research in reading comprehension, particularly how to best promote the development of proficient reading and prevent reading comprehension difficulties. Other questions addressed were: How can teachers be prepared to deliver effective comprehension instruction? and How can an assessment system for reading ccmprehension be developed that includes the design of valid and reliable measures of self-regulated, strategic reading that are sensitive to instructional interventions? This book sets out the RRSG's framework and presents the group's conclusions about improving the research infrastructure for teaching reading comprehension. The book proposes a reading research agenda and addresses issues that the community of reading researchers urgently needs to address over the next 10 to 15 years. Appendixes contain an expanded review of the research on variability in reading comprehension, and an outline of a sample request for application. (Contains approximately 345 references.).

    Too many students entering colleges or universities find that they lack the essential skills and knowledge required for college. One reason for high school graduates' lack of preparedness for college is a serious lack of communication between the preschool-12 and postsecondary education systems. Like other states, Minnesota has focused considerable time, energy, and resources on understanding this and other challenges facing the state's students, educators, and institutions. These efforts have resulted in a number of innovative and successful initiatives, including the following, to improve students' success after high school: (1) tech prep and school to work programs to meet the needs of students with skills, talents, and interests in pursuing various technical education and career options; (2) postsecondary enrollment options and other "college credit" opportunities or college-bound students; (3) developmental education opportunities complemented by reporting and early assessment; (4) graduation standards/college preparation alignment; (5) improved documentation of student achievement; and (6) charter schools. In view of Minnesota's experience, the following general approaches were recommended to policymakers and educators interested in preparing high school students for success in postsecondary education and work: (1) initiate an information campaign to articulate preparation for post-high school success; (2) identify and support "best practices"; and (3) document student achievement. (Contains 17 references.).

    A 5-year longitudinal study was designed to examine diverse and promising programs to integrate career and technical education (CTE) with whole-school reforms in schools serving predominantly disadvantaged students. A literature review focused on conceptual underpinnings: disadvantaged youth; transition points; whole-school reform; and CTE. Longitudinal descriptions were provided of CTE-enhanced whole-school reforms with strong track records of improving educational chances of concentrated groups of highly disadvantaged students: Perkins III, High Schools That Work, career academies, career pathways, and urban learning centers. Second-year findings were based on qualitative data gathered to date. Progress of 3 cohorts of students--seventh, ninth, and eleventh grade--was followed as they proceeded through 10 schools at 3 sites. Findings indicated all three high schools had integrated CTE and academic education; faculty at high schools participated in many professional development activities; all high schools used computers--for student assessment and reporting requirements, teaching students about computers, instruction, and remediation; all middle schools were involved in some reform effort; strong leadership was a crucial factor in effecting change across all high schools; and administrators and faculty.

    The passage of the No Child Left Behind Act marks the most significant shift in federal education policy in 3 5 years. It calls for a revolutionary change in the culture and values of the American educational system and a transformation in the U.S. Department of Education's (DE) accountability practices. In the coming years, the DE will lead a national campaign to change the culture of the nation's education system. To accomplish this reform, the DE set six goals: (1) create a culture of achievement; (2) improve student achievement; (3) develop safe schools and strong character; (4) transform education into an evidence-based field; (5) enhance the quality of and access to postsecondary and adult education; and (6) establish management excellence. In this report, each goal is broken down into a series of objectives that lead to concrete results. Easy-to-read charts supplement the text. The ultimate objective of this act is to improve student achievement so that individuals may contribute to our democracy, economy, and communities, and live their own American dreams.

    Taking effect in Fall 2002, the No Child Left Behind legislation will help to enable a high-quality education for every child in America, regardless of income, ability, or background. The legislation gives states more flexibility on how they spend their education dollars, and in return, requires them to set standards for student achievement and to hold students, teachers, and other educators accountable for results. No Child Left Behind also gives parents new opportunities to ensure that their children receive the very best education possible. This guide for parents outlines what they need to know about the legislation. Using a question and answer format, the guide details the legislation's impact in the areas of: (1) accountability, including requirements for states and school districts to publish report cards on school performance; (2) testing, including effects of testing requirements on teaching; (3) reading, including why it is important for children to read better so early in school, and the goals of the Reading First initiative; (4) what works, detailing the role of scientifically based research in the legislation requirements; (5) teachers, including how parents can help their child's teacher; (6) creating safer schools, including the "Unsafe School Choice Option"; and (7) Choice, including who would be eligible for the school choice option and who can offer alternative schooling.

    Recognizing that communities can accomplish more for their children if all parts of the community work together in a collaborative effort, family-school-community-business par.tnerships have developed to provide comprehensive services to children and their families more effectively. This report contains information on the history, purposes, and structures of family-school-community-business partnerships and offers examples of such partnerships that are making a difference for children. Following introductory remarks, section 1 of the report discusses efforts to improve educational quality and accountability. Section 2 discusses the evolution of collaboration from the early 1900s to the present and presents the goals of family-school-community-business partnerships. Collaboration models are described, and three major types of partnership service-delivery models presented: school-based, school-linked, and community-based. Section 3 of the report describes the unique needs, key players, and primary characteristics of partnerships that target the following underserved or underrecognized areas: (1) early childhood education; (2) education of homeless children and youth; (3) education of migrant children, youth, and their families; (4) education of children of poverty; (5) preparation of teachers to work with children with learning disabilities; and (6) reduction of the achievement gap through improved educational opportunities. Section 4 describes the critical components of successful partnerships: client-access facilitators, delivery-system facilitators, and government facilitators. (Contains 128 references.).

    Historically, the role of career and technical education (CTE) has been a subject of debate. The various viewpoints regarding the best role for high school CTE can be condensed into the following options: (1) to provide an occupational sequence of courses that is integrated with rigorous academic course work as preparation for postsecondary pre-baccalaureate technical education or full-time employment; (2) to provide an occupational sequence of courses designed solely to prepare students for the transition from high school to full-time employment; (3) to retain CTE not as a sequential occupational program of study but as unique courses or a strategy providing an applied context for teaching academics; and (4) to eliminate high school CTE altogether in favor of a common academic program for all students. These four viewpoints/options were analyzed by using a student-centered analysis that included a review of available longitudinal and high school transcript data and focused on how to best meet the needs of individual students. The following topics were considered: CTEIs historical context; CTE's external/internal policy context; and characteristics and needs of CTE students. It was recommended that policymakers continue to support the model of integrated CTE. (Contains 20 references.).

    This publication brings together authors from a variety of fields to speculate about the future of counseling. Some believe that change in the future will be incremental and of a short-term nature, resolving problems as,they arise. Others see transitional changes that will be orderly and linear, while still others see transformational change with great new patterns evolving.

    "The Condition of Education, 2002" is an indicator report, summarizing the health of education, monitoring important developments, and showing trends in major aspects of education. Indicators examine relationships; show changes over time; compare or contrast subpopulations, regions, or countries; or assess characteristics of students from different backgrounds and types of schools. An indicator is policy relevant and problem oriented; it typically incorporates a standard against which to judge progress or regression. This year, 44 indicators were selected that represent a consensus of professional judgment about significant national measures of the condition and progress of education at this time. The report leads with special analyses of private schools and nontraditional undergraduates. The indicators that follow are in six sections: (1) Participation in Education; (2) Learner Outcomes; (3) Student Effort and Educational Progress; (4) Contexts of Elementary and Secondary Education; (5) Contexts of Postsecondary Education; and (6) Societal Support for Learning. The report includes text, tables, and charts for each indicator plus the technical supporting data, supplemental information, and data sources. Appendices compose over half of the publication and contain supplemental tables and notes, estimates of standard errors for the statistics, data sources, a glossary, and a bibliography that includes publications and surveys of the National Center for Education Statistics.

    P-16 education is an integrated system of education stretching from early childhood through a 4-year college, emphasizing continuity of student learning and alignment across school levels. It seeks to address problems with the present educational system, considering, for example, that "A" students in high-poverty schools score at the same level as llCfl and ItD"students in affluent schools, and 29 percent of college freshmen take one or more remedial courses in reading, writing, or mathematics. P-16 education has five central goals: to have every child ready for school by age 6, proficient in reading by 8, proficient in geometry and algebra by 13, completing a rigorous core curriculum by 17, and expected to complete the first 2 years of college by 21. P-16 strengths are inclusiveness, alignment, removal of artificial barriers, and reductions in level of remediation. Challenges include reliance on individual leaders, too little time, too much turf consciousness, lack of evidence, and lack of a common language. However, 25 states have passed P-16 legislation, implementing the system either as a broad, sweeping reform, or as a continuum of incremental changes. Further research is needed on the impact of P-16 on student achievement and appropriate forms of governance and finance. (Contains 12 references.).

    At the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., in September 2002, the U. S. Secretary of Education outlined the Bush Administration's ideas for education reform. This booklet contains the secretary's remarks. He focused on the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, presenting several examples of the act in action. He also discussed additional initiatives such as the State Scholars program, whose goals are to challenge students by providing more rigorous course work, not just for honor students but for all students, and Good Start, Grow Smart, a program that prepares children in Head Start and other early-childhood programs in language, literacy, and numerical skills. The secretary also touched upon professional development for teachers and teacher education, stressing the importance of mastery of a subject and stating, "Far too many teachers are not trained in the subjects they're teaching." Following his prepared remarks, the secretary fielded questions from the press corps. He addressed, briefly, school vouchers, SATs, teachers' pay, teachers' technology skills, academic achievement in rural schools, teacher training, government funding for education, career-oriented classes in high schools, ways to evaluate the effects of the No Child Left Behind Act, affirmative-action programs, and plans for improving K-12 math and science programs.

    http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/ERIC-ED475547/pdf/ERIC-ED475547.pdf

    This publication describes "race-neutral" programs being implemented across the United States to work toward diversity in higher education without granting preferences based on race and ethnicity. Educational institutions will find that there are dozens of race-neutral options available and that the early results of these programs are promising. The publication does hot endorse any particular program but does aim to foster innovative thinking about using race-neutral means to produce diversity among educational institutions. Race-neutral programs can be divided into two categories. Most attention is focused on admissions plans, but a large category of race-neutral efforts encompasses those designed to develop the skills, resources, and abilities of students who might not otherwise apply to and succeed in college. Descriptions of these developmental approaches include descriptions (1) expansion of advanced placement courses; (2) partnerships between colleges and low-performing schools; (3) partnerships between the College Board and educational institutions; (4) expansion of online course offerings; (5) expansion of financial aid; (6) recruitment and outreach; (7) College Summit; and (8) federal efforts (GEAR UP, TRIO Programs, and the State Scholars Initiative. Admissions approaches are also described, including socioeconomic approaches, targeted class-rank approaches, and the state programs of Texas, Florida, and California.

32. ED 481 811 - /Status and Trends in the Education of Blacks/, September 1, 2003. 

    http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/ERIC-ED481811/pdf/ERIC-ED481811.pdf

    This report examines progress on key education indicators of black children and adults, utilizing statistics published by the National Center for Education Statistics in various reports and from other federal agencies. It shows that more black students have completed high school and gone on to college, levels of parental education have increased, and the number of black individuals and families below the poverty level has decreased. Despite these gains, progress has been uneven over time and across various measures, and differences persist between blacks and whites on key indicators of educational performance. Blacks are more likely than whites or Hispanics to be enrolled in center-based preprimary education. Most black students attend public schools where minorities represent the majority of the student body. Blacks have higher dropout rates than whites but lower rates than Hispanics. Long term trends show increased reading and mathematics performance for black students. In 1999, more black and Hispanic than white children attended public schools chosen by their parents. However, a lower percentage of black and Hispanic than white children were in private schools. In 1999-2000, the proportion of associate degrees earned by blacks was greater than that of bachelor's degrees earned by blacks. Blacks in 2000 had higher unemployment rates than whites and Hispanics at every level of education. (Contains 56 bibliographic references and 89 tables.).

    http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/ERIC-ED482942/pdf/ERIC-ED482942.pdf

    This study examined how five high-poverty Texas high schools, which had attained notable achievement levels on selected academic indicators, reached their present levels of performance. The schools shared several characteristics: most students were economically disadvantaged; the location was in a large urban district; there was no selective admission; they had a Texas accountability rating of acceptable, recognized, or exemplary; and student achievement on at least one of three academic indicators was higher than the state average (the Texas Learning Index, the Algebra I End-of-Course Examination, or Advanced Placement enrollment and course offerings). Study data came from observations, documents, and interviews with administrators, teachers, school staff, students, parents, and district administrators. Results found that despite commonalities, each school implemented its practices in unique ways. Practices that were critical to high performance included setting clear goals and establishing high expectations, using data to guide instruction, focusing on instruction and individual learning, supporting teachers and enhancing collaboration, and fostering an environment of respect and affection for students.

    For nearly four decades, magnet schools have been an important element of American public school education. They have offered innovative programs not generally available in local schools and provided opportunities for students to learn in racially diverse environments. Magnet schools have been particularly important in districts that are trying to desegregate. This report examines the progress of MSAP (Magnet Schools Assistance Program) projects in achieving four legislative purposes of the Magnet Schools Assistance Program, including reducing minority group isolation, improving student achievement, promoting systemic reform, and encouraging innovative educational methods and practices. Also includes a glossary. (Contains 50 references and 32 exhibits.) (Author/MA).

** STRT /R/ scripts							:sec:
#<<app-R-scripts>>
I have written several /R/ scripts to perform the following functions (1) import the text files into /RQDA/, (2) export text from /RQDA/ into /tm/, (3) pre-process the text, and (4) run text mining analyses and build tabulations, diagrams, and plots (see previous figure \ref{fig:workflow}).

There are some /R/ routines that are computationally intensive. One of them is the 'stemming' of words. That is the reduction of words to a basic form by removing prefixes and suffixes.  For example "achieve", "achievement" both are stemmed into "achiev". I run those on the /Brazos/ cluster (see section [[quant-analysis][Quantitative analysis]]).  Some of the /R/ scripts are in two versions, one with and one without the high computational load components that can be run on a personal computer.

# tangle: C-c C-v t
# evaluate: C-c C-c

*** STRT Import text files into /RQDA/

These operations are not computationally intensive and can be run on a personal computer. Initially start /RQDA/ by entering at the /R/ prompt =library("RQDA")=.  Then, open or create a project and finally run the script as 

#+begin_src R
source("~/Dropbox/dissertation/data/<file name>.R", verbose=T)
#+end_src

where we substitute the true file name of the script.

#+begin_src R :tangle ~/Dropbox/dissertation/data/rqda-imp-congr-hearings.R
# import congressional hearings
#
setwd("~/Dropbox/dissertation/data/congr-hearings")
fnames <- list.files(pattern = ".txt$")
fcontent <- list()
#
for (i in 1:length(fnames)) fcontent[[i]] <- 
  paste(readLines(con = fnames[i]), collapse = "\n")
names(fcontent) <- fnames
write.FileList(fcontent)
#+end_src

The other scripts just replace the directory congr-hearings with congr-bills, congr-docs, pres-docs, and eric.

*** STRT Export from /RQDA/ into /tm/

This /R/ script will convert the text files of a RQDA project into a corpus.  It defines an /R/ function called =files2tm= that will be invoked from the R command line after the appropriate RQDA project is opened as: =source('~/Dropbox/dissertation/data/rqda2tm.R', echo=T)=. This operation is not computationally intensive and can be run on a personal computer.  At the end the corpus is saved into a file.  This file will be transferred to the computer cluster for further processing.

#+begin_src R :tangle ~/Dropbox/dissertation/data/rqda2tm-congr-hearings.R
files2tm.congr.hearings <- function(Code,language="eng")
{
 fcat <- RQDAQuery("select treefile.fid, filecat.name from treefile,
                    filecat on filecat.catid==treefile.catid 
                    and treefile.status==1
                    and filecat.status==1")
 Encoding(fcat$name) <- "UTF-8"
 names(fcat) <- c("id","filecat")
 txt <- RQDAQuery("select name, id, file, owner, date from source where status==1")
 txt <- merge(txt, fcat, by="id", all.x=TRUE, all.y=FALSE)
 Encoding(txt$file) <- "UTF-8"
 Encoding(txt$name) <- "UTF-8"
 congr.hearings.crp <- tm:::Corpus(tm::VectorSource(txt$file), 
   readerControl = list(language = language))
 meta(congr.hearings.crp, tag = c("fname","id","owner","date","filecat")) <- 
   txt[,c("name","id","owner","date","filecat")]
 summary(congr.hearings.crp)
 save(congr.hearings.crp, file = "~/Dropbox/dissertation/data/congr.hearings.Rdata")
}
#+end_src

The other scripts just replace =congr.hearings= with =congr.bills=, =congr.docs=, =pres.docs=, and =eric=.

*** STRT /tm/ pre-processing

This is computationally intensive and thus is run on the /Brazos/ computer cluster.  This script will pre-process the text corpus. Then the corpus is subjected to several type of text mining analysis processes and the results are tabulated or plotted or displayed in diagrams by using other R scripts.  Because the pre-processing runs for a long time I prefer to run these processes in parallel and thus have separate scripts for each corpus.

To run the script it is necessary to login onto =brazos.tamu.edu= by using =ssh=.  In my home directory are =pbs= scripts that have the code to start an /R/ session and run the /R/ script. For example to run the =pbs= script "import-hearing.pbs". enter the following at the command line: =run: qsub -q general -m abe import-hearing.pbs=.  There is a pbs script for each of the 5 corpora that needs to be created.

The /R/ code for a sample pbs and corresponding /R/ script is provided. Here is the =pbs= file that runs the /R/ script.

#+begin_src sh :tangle ~/Dropbox/dissertation/data/congr-hearings.pbs
#PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=8
#PBS -l walltime=05:00:00
#PBS -l mem=16GB
#PBS -q general

# run: qsub -q general -m abe congr-hearings.pbs

module load r/2.12.2/intel/64

cd $HOME
R CMD BATCH /home/hindiogine/preproc-congr-hearings.R

# Can I use bigrams instead of single tokens in a term-document matrix?
# Yes. RWeka provides a tokenizer for arbitrary n-grams which can be directly
# passed on to the term-document matrix constructor. E.g.:

BigramTokenizer <- function(x) NGramTokenizer(x, Weka_control(min = 2, max = 2))
tdm <- TermDocumentMatrix(bill.stem.crp, control = list(tokenize = BigramTokenizer))
