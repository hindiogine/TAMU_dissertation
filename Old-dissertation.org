# PURPOSE
It is my purpose to explore some aspects of the public funding for mathematics education. That is, how the awareness of the achievement gaps in the US school system has influenced this political activity. The specific subject of the teaching of mathematics has achieved great importance because of its purported relevance in an increasingly technological and fiercely competitive global world.  Also, this research has is interesting historically because it looks back to the roots Western civilization and modern thought, the Greece of the great philosophers.  Furthermore, I intend to discuss some methodological issues concerning the study of the history of education as well as some deep cultural currents relevant to today's (and previous) educational policy.

There has been limited research on political discourse regarding the federal funding of mathematics education, \cite<cf>{Apple:1992a,Payne:1999a,Martin:2003a}. However, I have not been able to find in the literature any study about the connection between the achievement gaps and the public funding of mathematics education at the federal, or national, level. 

# SPENDING FOR TEACHING - MATHEMATICS SPECIFICALLY
To set the scene for this exploration, let us imagine oneself as a first time visitor of an average town in the USA. Let us go around town and observe its buildings. The majority of the buildings will be single family houses, with some apartment complexes, and a few strip malls.  However, if we want to focus on buildings that show "wealth," we will see that the largest amount of financial expense, more than the court house, city hall, churches, or post office, is in its schools.  A fairly average high school will be more impressive than many universities in other countries. You will immediately notice a sports complex that would be the envy of most European universities. A closer inspection will usually show a library, computer and science labs, mechanics and carpentry shops, cafeteria, kitchen, theatre, and gym. These are facilities that most schools and many universities in the world can only dream of.    

This impression is confirmed by statistics. According to a recent report by the Organization for Economic Co-operation \cite{OECD:2005a} the countries who spend the most for their public school system were the USA and Switzerland at $11,000 per student per year.  According to the US Department of Education this figure was $9,683 during school year 2006-2007.[fn:62]  The total expenditure for public education was $476,825,866 during the same year.  We should be aware that in the USA the great majority of public funding for schools is local, that is, state and school district \cite<see e.g.>{Payne:1999a}. This reflects the local nature of public education in the country.  However, there is a nationalization policy trend in education as there are in other fields such as finance and health. This is apparent in the request, so far successfully opposed, to national education standards and testing and more explicitly, by the rising share of federal funding.  For instance in the 1919-1920 school year the national government contributed 0.3% of total revenues, but 4.5% in 1953-1954, and 8.5% in 2006-2007, the latest year for which data are available.[fn:85]

# For the State of Texas this figure was $36,105,784.[fn:63]  Detailed financial data is provided by 
# the Education Finance Statistics Center (EDFIN),[fn:64] which is part of the U.S. Department of 
# Education Institute of Education Sciences.[fn:71]

The most recent document by the \citeA[p. 204]{OECD:2010a} presented international financial data from the year 2007.  Their analysts have calculated, among other indicators, the cumulative expenditure per student over the theoretical duration of primary and secondary studies (Table B1.3a). The USA is ranked fourth at $129,327 after Luxembourg, Switzerland, and Norway (respectively at $209,407, $147,756, and $140,660).

Today in the USA we take for granted that in one form or another society has to provide the money to build and run schools, as well as hire teachers and non-teaching staff.  Historically this has not always been the case, though.  That the government of a nation pays for the education of all its citizen is a relatively recent phenomenon.  This concept slowly arose in Europe starting in the Middle Age. Our present situation in the USA is the result of a long historical process where the questions of whether one should learn a certain subject[fn:79] in the first place and if so, who should learn it, have had various answers.

# HISTORY TEACHING OF MATH
Historically, the implementation of public funding of schools has been closely associated with the move to free, universal, public, and compulsory education.  Indeed, today there is the USA no controversy of who should learn mathematics.  The answer is everyone and it has been so for about one hundred years.  The controversy in mathematics education has moved to other areas, the curriculum and the instructional methods. This controversy is so intense that it has been called the "Math Wars" \cite<see e.g.>{Loveless:2001b,Latterell:2005a}.

As we will see later in more detail, at the beginning of recorded history in ancient Mesopotamia, only wealthy families could afford to have their children educated \cite[p. 25]{Thomason:2005a}. The first mention of government paid education that I could find was much, much later in the Italy of the High Middle Ages where some municipal governments would hire teachers so that they could instruct the male children of the ruling class \cite[p.12-29]{Grendler:1989a}. However, this a local phenomenon and was not applied at the level of nation. Not surprisingly since the concept of nation was just starting to develop in Europe. In the USA the first state to institute compulsory public education was Massachusetts in 1852, followed by New York in 1853. These laws were inspired by the Prussian education system. This process was completed in 1918 when all states mandated at least elementary school education.

Another aspect of this historical phenomenon is the composition of the school curriculum. School time is a limited resource. Even a wealthy country can not fabricate time.  Hence various school subjects have to compete for time and attention.  Each of them has to propound its weighty merits in an almost Darwinian fashion.  Historically the study of the language has been the dominant, and often only, subject taught in schools \cite<see e.g.>[p. 1]{Black:2001a}.

# LANGUAGE VERSUS MATHEMATICS
The study of a language, and its literature, has great political implications. The study of English in the USA, or French in Quèbec has the function of preserving a type of culture that the dominant class and usually the majority of the population intends to protect and to guarantee its future.

During the history of the USA English was the language spoken by the majority. The only exception would be German in some areas, but two world wars waned its popularity. Usually the children of immigrants would only speak English well and maybe the original language of their parents badly. The grandchildren of the original immigrants would speak a little of their language while they were alive and quickly forget it afterwards. This is not the case anymore, especially for Spanish speaking immigrants.[fn:73] However, even the idea of granting another language equal status in public schools would stir great opposition[fn:74].  

# I have noticed that in stores where signs are displayed in both English and Spanish, 
# the second language is placed always in second position and in a smaller letter size.  
# The same I observed in the public transportation system in San Diego.  
# During history the language of the conqueror is usually imposed to the conquered[fn:66].

In contrast, the study of mathematics has a somewhat different function in a society. It could be argued that while language separates peoples into nations, mathematics does not.[fn:80]

# In Carl \citeA{Sagan:1985a}'s book /Contact/ the signal from outer space 
# was identified as coming from an intelligent source because 
# it was comprised of prime numbers.

Despite the importance and unifying nature of mathematics in a developed and educated society, the knowledge of mathematics has an ambivalent aspect to it.  While no caring parent would be pleased to be told by a teacher that their child has problems learning mathematics, many would candidly admit that they are "not good at mathematics" with the expectation that it generally will be socially acceptable \cite<see e.g.>[p. 210]{Fleener:2004a}.  Both a senator and a store clerk could make this admission publicly without any repercussion, and actually may evince sympathy and understanding from their audience.[fn:7]  On the contrary, no one would dare say "I am not good at English."  In the USA during the interview for naturalization, the candidate has to show proficiency in English.[fn:81] The Canadian province of Quèbec will reject any immigration applicant who will not pass a rigorous test of the French language.[fn:6]  In both cases knowledge of mathematics is not a factor at all.

# MATHEMATICS AND POLITICS
Nonetheless, when corporations test job candidates, they *are* tested for at least basic mathematical proficiency. This points to a connection between mathematical knowledge and economics. This is alluded at in, e.g., the Vision Statement of the The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM)[fn:12] 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The National Council of Teachers of Mathematics is a global leader and authority in mathematics education, ensuring that all students have access to the highest quality mathematics teaching and learning. We envision a world where everyone is enthused about mathematics, sees the value and beauty of mathematics, and is empowered by the opportunities mathematics affords.
#+END_QUOTE
(Approved by Board of Directors, October 25, 2008)[fn:14]

In the last statement, /empowered by the opportunities mathematics affords/, NCTM affirms the social and economic value of the knowledge of mathematics.

The organization has also a Statement of Beliefs consisting of 11 points.[fn:13] The first one reads

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Every student deserves an excellent program of mathematics education that challenges each student to achieve at the high level required for productive citizenship and employment.
#+END_QUOTE

\noindent
The NCTM stated that mathematical knowledge has value because of the individual benefit that it gives to the learner.  Of course, since society is composed of individuals, knowledge of mathematics has social implications, especially economic ones.[fn:82]

NCTM, even though very influential, is a non-governmental entity. Nonetheless, we can detect this same type of language in the publication of US federal government.  The USA Department of Education has established the 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the only nationally representative and continuing assessment of what America's students know and can do in various subject areas. Assessments are conducted periodically in mathematics, reading, science, writing, the arts, civics, economics, geography, and U.S. history.[fn:15]
#+END_QUOTE

\noindent
Note that the first subject in a list of nine subjects is mathematics.

Thus, the USA federal government at its highest level, the Department of Education, has likewise expressed the importance of mathematics education.  For example, the former Secretary of Education, Richard Riley, gave an speech at the 1998 meeting of the American Mathematical Society and the Mathematical Association of America \cite{Riley:1998a}. The following was stated

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Quite simply, a quality mathematics education /must/ be an integral part of today's experience.  In order to succeed in our information based society, students must have a solid understanding of the basics--reading, science, history, the arts--and smack at the center of this base of essential knowledge, must be mathematics.
....
It should come as no surprise then that almost 90 percent of new jobs require more than a high school level of literacy and math skills.
#+END_QUOTE

More recently, President Barack Obama gave a speech on the "Education To Innovate" Campaign.  Here are some excerpts[fn:40]

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We live in a world of unprecedented perils, but also unparalleled potential.  Our medical system holds the promise of unlocking new cures -- but it's attached to a health care system that's bankrupting families and businesses and our government.  The sources of energy that power our economy are also endangering our planet.  We confront threats to our security that seek to exploit the very openness that is essential to our prosperity.  And we face challenges in a global marketplace that link the trader to Wall Street to the homeowner on Main Street, to the office worker in America to the factory worker in China  -- an economy in which we all share in opportunity, but we also share, unfortunately, in crisis.

The key to meeting these challenges -- to improving our health and well-being, to harnessing clean energy, to protecting our security, and succeeding in the global economy -- will be reaffirming and strengthening America's role as the world's engine of scientific discovery and technological innovation.  And that leadership tomorrow depends on how we educate our students today, especially in those fields that hold the promise of producing future innovations and innovators.  And that's why education in math and science is so important.

Now the hard truth is that for decades we've been losing ground.  One assessment shows American 15-year-olds now rank 21st in science and 25th in math when compared to their peers around the world.  And this isn't news.  We've seen worrying statistics like this for years.  Yet, time and again, we've let partisan and petty bickering stand in the way of progress.  And time and again, as a nation, we've let our children down. 

So I'm here and you are here because we all believe that we can't allow division and indifference to imperil our position in the world.  It's time for all of us -- in Washington and across America -- to take responsibility for our future.
#+END_QUOTE

We should take notice of a distinctly mythical-political theme in this discourse.  We are going beyond learning mathematics for your own or your family's interest, beyond just the welfare of the country, it is about /our position in the world/ that is in danger. This is a peculiar type of language that is absent in the public discourse of most other nations.  This concept was recently elaborated by David \citeA{Gewirtz:2010a}

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
You see, when most people think of "national security," they think of our armed services or protecting against terrorism. Sometimes, they’ll add law enforcement to the mix, and since 2001, many people also think of homeland security as a part of national security.

But a confident middle class, a solid job market, and a healthy populace are as relevant to national security as any tank or gun. Industrial might is what really won World War II for America.

Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was Supreme Commander of the Allies in Europe during World War II, once said:

/Throughout the struggle, it was in his logistic inability to maintain his armies in the field that the enemy’s fatal weakness lay. Courage his forces had in full measure, but courage was not enough. Reinforcements failed to arrive, weapons, ammunition and food alike ran short, and the dearth of fuel caused their powers of tactical mobility to dwindle to the vanishing point. In the last stages of the campaign they could do little more than wait for the Allied advance to sweep over them./

Almost two centuries earlier, Thomas Jefferson pondered America’s industrial capacity, saying:

/Experience has taught me that manufacturers are now as necessary to our independence as to our comfort./

The key to our industrial might is successful, operational, and highly functional companies. Those companies need workers to churn out their products. Without this solid industrial base and effective workforce, America would never have won World War II.
#+END_QUOTE

Similar language is found in earlier documents, such as the "National Defense Education Act" (1958) and "A Nation at Risk" \cite{NCEE:1983a}.

In addition, also the business community has expressed its interest in mathematics (and science) education.  For example, the Committee for Economic Development, a non-profit, non-partisan business led public policy organization[fn:93], has recently published a statement on education \cite{CED:2003a}. Here I reproduce its executive summary (p. 1)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Improving the math and science skills of our young people is an important step towards maintaining innovation-led economic growth in the coming decades. While producing a more scientifically proficient citizenry, widespread math and science achievement will also widen the pipeline of scientists and engineers who drive innovation.  This report investigates the challenges confronting math and science education from the perspective of culture change.  The culture surrounding math and science achievement is often negative: students who succeed in these fields are often dismissed by their peers, while a culture of low expectations burdens other groups, perpetuating their underrepresentation in the professional technical labor force. To address these issues, CED calls for the implementation of a strategic plan that will increase student “demand” for and achievement in mathematics and science. CED believes that all stakeholders in math and science education policy, including state and local governments, school districts, and business, must be 
#+END_QUOTE

We can notice references to both the economic importance of mathematics education and the achievement gap. A slightly more recent report by the Business-Higher Education Forum[fn:94] \cite{BHEF:2005a}, titled /A Commitment to America's Future: Responding to the Crisis in Mathematics & Science Education/ expressed similar sentiments (p. 1)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Mathematics and science — and the technological innovation they support — are critical to our country’s competitive position in the global economy and to its security in an increasingly perilous geo-political environment. Competence in mathematics and science are thus essential to us as individuals and as a nation.  We all have a stake in ensuring that all Americans are educated properly in these fields.
#+END_QUOTE

Another publication on mathematics education, global competitiveness and the achievement gap recently released by a business organizations is \citeA{BRT:2005a}.  Analogous material was published by \citeA{NatAcad:2009a} as well as academics \cite<e.g.>{Anderson:1992a}.

Already 50 years ago U.S. Navy Admiral Hyman G. Rickover criticized the public schools in our country, even if he did mention mathematics indirectly through his emphasis in science and engineering.  However, he was only concerned about the international achievement gap, not the national one.  He could actually be considered an educational elitist \cite[p. 110-111]{Angus:1999a}.  On a more official note, DARPA has expresses the danger of low interest of students in STEM studies and has issued requests for proposal in computer science and STEM education.[fn:96]

Thus, we have seen that the relevant professional organization (NCTM), business and other organizations and political entities at the highest level have expressed the importance of mathematics education. Note that these are but a few among many statements.  The counterpoint to these statements is that many authorities, be they political, professional, or academic that have expressed that the reality of the educational situation in the USA does not rise to meet these goals and aspirations.  This situation, be it real or perceived, is called  the /Achievement Gap/.  Again, I am but concerned about perceptions, not whether an achievement gap may exist and its actual importance and relevance to the economic and political status of the country

# DEFINITION OF GAPS - DISCUSSION
Usually there are two forms that this /Gap/ is understood.[fn:67]  One is at a global or international level, where it refers to the low or at least mediocre ranking of USA students in several international educational assessments, primarily the /Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study/ (TIMSS)[fn:86] \cite{Mullis:2008a,Mullis:2004a,Mullis:2000a}, and Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)[fn:87] \cite{OECD:2010a,OECD:2005a}.  The other understanding is at a national level. The USA is peculiar it its socio-legal structure.  In most countries that are not ethnically homogeneous the distinction is made on a linguistic and/or religious level.  For example, Canadian Law divides the population of its country between French and English speakers, Belgium between German, French and Dutch speakers, and Switzerland between German, French, Italian and Romansh. Most Muslim countries divide their population up according to religious affiliation[fn:83] while no regard is given to linguistic minorities.[fn:41] However, the USA does categorize its citizens on so-called race and ethnicity.  Race is at best a vague pseudo-genetic characterization of a person.  Many researchers consider it a social construct as much as ethnicity, language, or religion.  For a more exhaustive discussion of this issue \citeA<see>{Root:2000a}.

When language is the measured category, then the USA has another peculiarity.  There are basically two linguistic categories in the USA: "English" and "English Language Learner."[fn:88] Not language A and language B as in all other countries.  An unexpected (by me) parallel I found was in a Kurdish movie where the Iraqi Arab army official told the Kurdish draftee to speak proper Arabic to be like a civilized person.[fn:84]  We are more aware of the Greeks habit of dividing humans between "Greek speaking" and "barbarians" even though none less than the great Plato (428/427 - 348/347 BCE) disagreed with this (cf. /Statesman/ 262de).[fn:89]

From a legal point of view in the USA the categorization of race and ethnicity is defined by The Office of Management and Budget (OMB).  Its latest revision was done in 1997 \cite[p. 1]{Kewal:2007a}.  The OMB defined the following categories as races: Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and White.  The office has one ethnic category: Hispanic or Latino.  These definitions, either race or ethnicity, are based on solely geography, which is a clear sign that we have to do with social constructs. Basically, the race or ethnicity of a person is based on his or her country of origin if not born in the USA or of their ancestors if US-born. This all of course begs the question of what if the ancestors, or even worse, parents come from countries that were in listed under different 'races'? This also flies in the face that, if we were pressed to come up with any scientifically viable concept of race it would have to be hereditary or genetic.  Similarly, it would be quaint to refer to ethnicity without referring to language, culture, or religion.  However, that is precisely what the OBM does not do.  I have the impression that the OBM is trying to "square the circle".  It has received a mandate that is impossible to accomplish within the politically and culturally accepted boundaries. Furthermore, the social concepts of race and ethnicity are in tension with the idea of the great American /melting pot/.  Or more precisely, the mixing should not cross 'racial' lines?[fn:42]

A further difference is that in USA society and legislation certain 'races' are considered to be privileged and others to be oppressed and active policy has to be implemented to readdress this inequality.  By comparison, in Canada English and French speakers are considered to be of equal 'status.'  There is an issue with protection of /French/ as a language, but not as an ethnic group.  Ironically the French speakers consider themselves superior to the English speakers from a cultural point of view.[fn:92]

In most countries when social inequalities are addressed, it is based on income level, or /socioeconomic status/. Historically, Indo-European societies have been divided into two broad groups, the nobles (numerically the minority) and the common people (the vast majority of the population).  We usually call them classes even though we may as well call them casts because there was no intermarriage.  The United States was founded, with some restrictions, as a republic of equals. Hence the national myth of the /classless society/ \cite{Kingston:2000a,Langston:2000a,Mantsios:2010a}.[fn:90]

# GK: You need to acknowledge the confluence of racial and socioeconomic issues, and the double jeopardy it causes, along with often ignoring or diminishing the issue of poor White students.

The USA is unique among the nations in the world in considering "race" a significant demographic and thus political categorization.  The only other example known to me in the modern world was apartheid South Africa.  While the US constitution does not mention anything about race or ethnicity, the whole legal framework in from national to local is permeated with references to race and ethnicity.

The United States is the only one among the so-called western countries in having experienced slavery in the "homeland".  Other countries did only have slaves in the colonies, but the USA originated as a series of British colonies with slaves.  So, in a certain sense, the USA was its own slave colony.  Similarly, Brazil became independent in 1822 and only abolished slavery in 1888, even later than in the USA. However, the concept of race is not in its legislation.

However, it makes some sense to talk about race in the struggle for a more just and equitable society.  The descendants of the freed slaves, if considered as a group, do score lower on almost all socio-economic indicators than all other groups, except perhaps the Hispanics.  It is not the place here to discuss the hows and the whys of this phenomenon.  It suffices to restate the known situation that Afro-Americans students do, with Hispanic and Native American students, score significantly lower than those of European descent and even less than those of North-East Asian descent.  This is called the /internal/ or /national achievement gap/. 

There is of course a strong relationship between descent and wealth if we measure it is relative terms.  The rate of poverty is higher among those of African descent than those of European stock.  However, there are more "white" poor than there are Afro-Americans in the USA.  Being of African descent and poor makes it especially difficult for a student to score well on standardized tests for many reasons that we can not discuss here.  A poor student of European descent can, as Huckleberry Finn,[fn:91] still pretend to be of higher social status than one of African descent. 

Some have theorized that the peculiar US policy of focusing on race rather than on socio-economic status in schools as well as in society at large has the function of deflecting the public attention from class to race \cite{Tozer:2000a}.  Attention on the former (class) causes revolutions, but attention to the second causes merely riots. Considering that nowadays the rich and powerful are now also geographically separated from those who are not, a riot for them is a minor inconvenience compared to a revolution.

Previously a noteworthy form of achievement gap was based on gender.  However, today this has less and less force because scores for female students are not significantly different from male students and there are actually signs that the scores for females are surpassing those of the other gender.  There are other possible ways of looking for 'gaps' such as proficiency in the English language or geographical (rural, suburban, inner-city). \citeA{Gregory:2010a} have recently described the 'discipline gap' the racial/ethnic disparity in disciplinary actions as being closely related to the achievement gap. \citeA{Stigler:2009a} wrote a monograph on the 'teaching gap', the disparity in the quality of teaching between the U.S.A. and other countries.

# The global achievement gap and national achievement gap are of course closely related phenomena.  
# The national achievement gap will depress average scores on the national level and thus lower 
# the ranking of the USA on an international scale.

** STRT Objectives and Goals of the Study				:sec:
#<<objectives>>

The objective of the proposed study is to document and analyze the justifications given by the national, that is federal, institutions of the United States for the funding of mathematics education. This will be done in the light of two social conditions.  The first one is the effects of the mathematics (and science) scores of the /Programme for International Student Assessment/ (PISA)[fn:1] and of the /Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study/ (TIMMS),[fn:2] and the second one is the existence, as well as stubborn persistence, of the national and international achievement gaps \cite<see e.g.>{Braun:2006a}.  There are other important events and phenomena that are contributing to the effects under study such as the publication in 1983 of the report /A Nation at Risk/ \cite{NCEE:1983a},[fn:3] de-industrialization, globalization, and what can be called the disappearance of "well-paying jobs" for those having only a high school degree or less.[fn:4]

My goal is to describe and uncover these discourses on the funding of mathematics education. More precisely, I want to shed light on the discourses made in the public arena that have legitimized this funding and firmly established in the national conscience that the knowledge of mathematics is essential to the prosperity, nay the survival of the nation.

What I am not concerned with is whether the above events and phenomena are the manifestations of an actual, real worsening of the situation in schools in the USA.  I am interested in the *perception* of the health of the public schools by the citizens in general and of the political and economic leadership specifically.  Whether a phenomenon is a /problem/ or not is but a social construct.  Intrinsically nothing is a problem because a problem is a value statement and thus is historically and socially determined.  Furthermore, even if we grant that, e.g., a downtrend in national average SAT mathematics scores is a problem, it still may be a statistical artifact that has only mathematical validity, but does not refer to anything of meaning in the real world.  Thus, it could be stated, using Foucaultian terminology, that I am problematizing the problematization of the achievement gaps.

Schooling, be it public or private, requires significant financial resources. Functioning schools need money for, among others, teachers and staff payroll, premises, sports fields, buses, books, furniture, cafeteria and office supplies, musical instruments, computers and software, and gym equipment. As we have above mentioned, today in the USA its citizens generally consider it normal that, in one form or another, society has to provide all this money so that all residents in the country have access to free and universal education from kindergarten to 12^th grade.  In addition, as reported previously, the USA is very generous in its public support compared to most other countries in the world.

The national budget by definition is limited, even if in the case of the United States still very large \cite[p. 50]{Hanushek:2009a}.  Hence the necessity for its allocation among entities and interests that are fiercely competing for it.  The outcome of this process of allocation depends on the relative influence and authority of competing constituencies.  The primary and largest items in the federal budget are defense, Medicare & Medicaid, and interest on the national debt.  That ensures that the competition for the remainder of the budget be intense.  Education has to compete with infrastructures, environmental protection, international assistance, law enforcement, block grants, R&D, and a whole host of other interests.

The battle field for this struggle for funding is the public mind.  The sphere of public discourse where attention has to be sought by the use of more or less cogent logic and by the appeal to certain sentiments that are more or less noble.

# GK ######## Need a little more of an introductory paragraph to transition to the next ones on the value and importance of mathematics as it competes for the limited resources. Also, a brief justification for looking to ancient history for a context (or at lease mention that his justification is provided later in this section).

So, how has the teaching of mathematics fared in this competition for funds?  Why would a government allocate any money at all to this task, what are the justifications for it in the public discourse \cite<see e.g.>[p. 51]{Doherty:2006a}.  In addition, it is helpful to look into the past for any trends and new ideas on this subject.

The teaching of mathematics is in a peculiar situation.  Few school children would choose to study it if they were free to choose.  Most adults would be of the same opinion.  Most adults consider themselves deficient in mathematics.  Basically it is a field of knowledge that few are interested in and knowledgeable about.  On the other hand, mathematics is with English the most frequently tested school subject.  It is in /all/ standardized tests: SAT, ACT, GRE, etc.

To understand this situation we need to find out how it has come about.  Is this a new development or an ancient one?  We need some historical investigation.

Literacy and numeracy have been considered valuable fields of knowledge since ancient times. However, the learning of reading and writing has always been the primary and often the only skill that was taught. The learning of mathematics was considered much less important than the learning of one's mother tongue and the /lingua franca/.[fn:19] Often the teaching of mathematics was considered unnecessary for the normal students and reserved for the élite. Moreover, when the learning of mathematics was enjoined it was for reasons far from today's concerns.  Plato considered the mathematics of "merchants and retail-traders" a form of knowledge inferior to that which was required of the military and state leaders, who should "study until they see the nature of numbers with their mind only" (Plato, /The Republic/ 525bc).  This attitude towards mathematics lasted until recent times and can still be recognized in the educational polemic called /The Math Wars/ \cite<see e.g.>{Latterell:2005a}.

Returning to the writings of Plato, it is remarkable how a book on, among other subjects, teaching written more than two thousand years ago on another continent can be so promptly related to today's mathematics educational controversies in the USA. We could place Plato in the camp of those who prefer a constructivist inspired way of teaching mathematics versus those who support a procedural, practical pedagogy. For instance

In all these establishments there should reside teachers [804d] attracted by pay from abroad for each several subject, to instruct the pupils in all matters relating to was and to music; and not father shall either send his son as a pupil or keep him away from the training-school at his own sweet will, but every "man jack" of them all (as the saying goes) must, so far as possible, be compelled to be educated, inasmuch as they are children of the State even more than children of their parents.

#+END_QUOTE 

I would like these statements to be my starting point for a journey of investigation that will encounter some great minds, most of them well know and others less so, until we arrive at today's discourse about the national value of mathematical knowledge.

# Alla fine
Here I formulate the hypothesis that when a nation bases its prosperity and future on technology it will place the teaching of mathematics alongside the teaching of the official language in the preservation of its national sovereignty. The knowledge of the national language is necessary for internal cohesion and the survival of the culture, while the knowledge of mathematics is essential for its survival as a nation in an environment where commerce, finance and technology is important.

Thus it is evident that there is a 'connection' between the funding of mathematics education and some social and cultural conditions in the USA.  However, I will dispense with any pretention of being able to explain the historical phenomenon "funding for mathematics teaching" by any attribution to specific causal mechanism(s).   The difficulty of establishing causality does not imply that causality does not exist.  However, attribution of causes in history is usually more an indication of the historian's political and ideological ideas than any reference to the discovery of any actual causal agent that connects without any solution of discontinuity the events and at the same time also completely exhausts all effects and influences of a particular historical event.

We all are aware that if we ask the apparently simple question such as "what is the cause of homelessness in the USA today?" we obtain all sorts of answers. Usually we will be able to discern a pattern between these answers and political opinions. Moving to a subject closer to out theme, let us ask "what are the causes of the failure of mathematics teaching in the public schools of the USA today, and what it its solution?"

I identify those as the emotions of fear and pride. I understand these emotions to operate at various levels, starting with the fear for the welfare of their offspring \cite[p. xiii]{Wagner:2008a} to the fear of the survival of the nation (see /A Nation at Risk/, 1983).[fn:72] The basic emotion of fear is related to the higher emotion of pride. In this situation it could be the feeling of being a good parent, the gladness of knowing that their children will be successful. And at a higher level of social aggregation, the knowledge that their nation is the greatest one on earth, the envy of all other countries.[fn:39]

To make a convincing case for this connection I will use several theoretical frameworks and the philosophical constructions and discourse analysis techniques provided by some of the Continental philosophers and social researchers. More specifically I avail myself of the works of 

+ Roland Barthes, Claude Lévi-Strauss - /mythology/
+ Michel Foucault - /power, knowledge, governmentality/
+ Antonio Gramsci, Chantal Mouffe - /hegemony, culture/
+ Pierre Bourdieu, Jacques Rancière - /culture, society/
+ Slavoj \v{Z}i\v{z}ek - /culture, symbols, ideology/

I would also like to make a historical comparison that I find illuminating. History does not repeat itself, but parallels and comparisons can be made that will give us some insight into a contemporary situation. In my opinion, the emotional state of the French people and as well as its government after the disaster of the Seven Years' War[fn:24] presents interesting correspondences with the contemporary United States.  I do not refer to the Vietnam War[fn:25] or the attack of 9/11.[fn:26]  Those two disasters have never been related to the mathematical or scientific knowledge of the US population. On the contrary, the tragic loss of manufacturing jobs and the abyss of the trade deficit have been connected, among many other factors, to the perceived inadequate mathematical and scientific education in the public schools. Similarly, the technological inferiority of the French artillery and the mathematical ignorance of its artillerists was considered to be one the main causes of the tragic defeat of France.  Other interesting historical parallels that have to bear are that both the France of the 17^th century and the USA of today were considered to be the most powerful nations on earth and that both combine great national wealth with horrendous national budget deficits.

A possible critique of my approach is the realization that any claim of causal relationship in history and sociology has to face the objection that due to the complexity of the forces in play any explanation can be sustained, and is thus in ultimate analysis meaningless. Even today we are still debating the "real" cause of the fall of the Roman Empire. In addition, any appeal to a emotions is vapid because emotions drive all human beings to perform many different actions and make many discordant choices.

I certainly agree. However, my intention is not to prove a phenomenon in a scientific, experimental sense. Rather it is to navigate through the history of education to study the motivations, be they superficially stated or uncovered by analysis, for the financial support of mathematics education.   I will attempt to understand what social, economic, military, and political conditions made those in power decide to allocate for the teaching of mathematics increasing amounts of resources.  The distribution of the national budget is a `zero sum game.'  The decision to give money to any program or agency can only occur when the discourse that supports it becomes intelligible. When certain practices, intentions, and desires become part of the public sphere to become tacitly and implicitly part of the 'normal' functioning of society.  

# GK: not a sentence ###########################
Basically, by problematizing the funding of mathematics education I will to bring to light certain social and cultural connections between the knowledge of mathematics and power. This analysis can be performed both at an intra-national and inter-national level. In the first instance we will look at the discourse around the national achievement gap and in the second one at the international achievement gap.

# GK: I like to see reference; limit the use of ‘this’ ########################
To do so, I propose to look at certain periods and places in Western history that I consider relevant to the research project through the theoretical lenses provided by the above mentioned scholars. These relevant periods are locations in history where we can find discontinuities in thought about the value of mathematical knowledge in society \cite{Hook:2005a}.

# GK: Since I have proposed changing the title of this section, I also suggest that the following methodologies be introduced in terms of having as your objectives to use these particular methods and perspectives. Maybe you need a separate section here titled something like Definitions and Assumptions? ===== MOVE to Methodology

# references to authors that have done the same ##############
Here I follow the method, but not the theory, of the continental scholars Michel Foucault \cite{Ball:1990a,Foucault:1991a} and Jacques \citeA{Ranciere:1991a}.

My main starting point will be two of Foucault's methodologies 'genealogy', \cite{Scheurich:2005a,Hunter:1996a,May:1993a} and especially `governmentality' \cite{Dean:1999a,Foucault:1991a,Peters:2009a,Hook:2005a}.  Those will be discussed in the methodology section (chapter 3).

I will use as guides some studies in education that have been done using these tools. Mainly \citeA{Knight:1990a} who presented their "critical appreciation of official state policies" concerning school curriculum in Australia; and Jane \citeA{Kenway:1990a} who studied how certain political forces "have all but colonized popular thinking and government policy on education in Australia." \citeA{Blades:1997a} described and analyzed a (failed) science education reform project in Canada. More recent studies of this type in mathematics education were performed by Rong-Ji \citeA{Chen:NDa} and Thomas \citeA{Popkewitz:2004a}.

The contributions by Pierre Bourdieu in the sociology of culture are profound.  He has extensively studied school systems \cite<e.g.>{Bourdieu:1990a}.  In an interview he stated the importance of studying schools as places where in modern societies people are build (constructed) in direct relation with their families. However, in schools also social differences are constructed and different social groups guarantee their continuation.[fn:27]

Knowledge as culture has been studied in relation to hegemony between social groups by Antonio \citeA{Gramsci:1992a} and his thought have been updated by Chantal Mouffe \cite{Laclau:2001a}. While these concepts are not directly related to my investigations, they provide useful insights into the structure of society and nations as they compete through history for hegemony or mere survival. Plato thought that knowledge of abstract ideas distinguished the rulers from the mere merchants form whom numbers where only intelligible in the context of material goods. Similarly, Antonio \citeA[4.55]{Gramsci:1992a} understood that classical, abstract knowledge was the domain of the ruling class and advocated such type of education for the lower classes as a prerequisite for participation in the affairs to the nation. Pierre Bourdieu called this type of knowledge /cultural capital/ \cite[p. 30]{Bourdieu:1990a}.

Another field of inquiry that I need to explore is national mythology. The views that citizens have about their country.  Its origin and destiny, its place among the nations and in history. About its virtues and strengths.  What is good or bad for the country.  What a citizen should aspire to and become. The theoretical framework was created by Claude Lévi-Strauss, even though his view are dated. The most highly regarded contemporary study is by Roland \citeA{Barthes:1972a} on mythology.

# This doesn’t fit here; not sure where it goes.
Finally I consider important the related concept by Slavoj \citeA[p. 306]{Zizek:2006a} of the "state of emergency."  Clearly, the idea of a national emergency has been advanced several times to advocate for public support of the teaching of mathematics, from the French defeat in the Seven Years' War to /A Nation at Risk/.

\citeA{Gough:2000a} describes /methodology/ as the "reasoning that informs particular ways of doing research, or the principles that inform the organization of research activity" and also as "conceptual framework or the assumptions that guide their research" and "reasons for using such techniques in relation to the kind of knowledge or understanding the researcher is seeking."

The study of social perceptions as evinced from public statements is obviously a study not of "objects" and not even of "behaviour," but of ideas and of discourses. Whether the statement itself is true or not is not the issue, and even its meaning is not relevant. I am interested in understanding what counts and what does not, what is perceived as correct and what is not. But I intend to go beyond this.  I also want to study what is not said, what is missing, or more precisely, what does not have to be said. This is the domain of "discourse analysis," especially the types of discourse analysis developed by Michel Foucault.[fn:28] \citeA[pp. 871--872]{Perakyla:2005a} explains that according to Foucault a discourse creates subjects and objects that are explored in a historical context through methodologies that Foucault named /archaeology/ and /genealogy/ \cite{Scheurich:2005a}. \citeA{Hook:2001a,Hook:2005a}  explicitly considered the discourse analysis performed by using Foucault's genealogy and archaeology a `methodology.'[fn:29]  \citeA{Knight:1990a} and \citeA{Kenway:1990a} analyze the truth claims in official state policies that are in a discourse competition with statements from pressure groups and the media. They weave the practice of deconstruction[fn:30] with the concepts of hegemony and competing truth claims, dominant ideology and social myths.

Epistemology is the study of "How do we know what we know?" and "How can we increase our knowledge?"  A related question is "How can I be sure that what I believe to be true is actually true?" In the field of education, the two main epistemologies are post-positivist and constructivist.

Positivist epistemology supposes that research is performed by a "objective, detached observer" \cite[Table 1]{Gough:2000a}. Moreover, the researchers can be highly confident (positivism) or probabilistically confident (post-positivism) that the results they obtain have a direct correspondence with the components of reality.[fn:31]

# There are many complex concepts that are in the domain of study of epistemology, such as \textit{reductionism}, \textit{verification}, \textit{falsification}, \textit{causality}, \textit{objectivity/subjectivity}, \textit{empiricism}, and \textit{pragmatism}. 

Constructivist thought in the West has been present sporadically from the time of
the pre-Socratics. Statements that align themselves with contemporary constructivist philosophy have been expressed by Protagoras\footnote{ca. 490 - 420 BCE. Plato in /Theaetetus/, 152a cites a famous saying of Protagoras, "man is the measure of all things" (trans. 1921). This statement was interpreted by Plato in /Theaetetus/ in a constructivist way /Well, is not this about what he means, that individual things are for me such as they appear to me, and for you in turn as they appear to you - you and I being "man"?/  However, Plato rejected the idea} and Giambattista Vico.[fn:32] Contemporary scientists who have contributed mostly to constructivism are Jean Piaget \cite[pp. 167--177]{Dimitriadis:2006a}, Lev Vygotsky (pp. 191--199), and Ernst von \citeA{Glasersfeld:2000a}. von \citeauthor{Glasersfeld:2000a} describes this epistemology as one that "holds that knowledge is under all circumstances constructed by individual thinkers as an adaptation to their subjective experience." (p. 4).

As we have seen by moving up from methods (analysis of texts) to methodology (archaeology, genealogy, and deconstruction), we are not working with data that can be measured, manipulated, and tabulated. We are not generating an input for a conceptual device that is able to verify or falsify causal claims.[fn:33]   With this in mind, using Guba and Lincoln's \cite[p. 193]{Guba:2005a} categorizations we find "Hermeneutical/dialectical" under the Constructivism paradigm. In addition, the authors connect constructivism, as well as post-structuralism and postmodernism, explicitly with genealogy and archaeology (p. 204). 

Does this all make sense with respect to my research questions? How do I obtain my answers following a Foucaultian methodology? Not by `finding' them somewhere `out there.' I do build them in my mind while I analyze text that I have gathered (method) using genealogy, archaeology, and deconstruction (methodology).  This process is only intelligible within a constructivist worldview. The answers are indeed `my' answers.

Ontology is the study of "what is." It asks what the relationship between our mind and our environment is.  Historically, philosophy based on the Greek tradition maintains that there is a reality that is independent of our minds. Platonists go even further and claim that even our abstract ideas have a sort of autonomous existence. The modern conception of reality mostly follows the dualism of René Descartes,[fn:34] who encapsulated this idea in his famous statement "Je pense, donc je suis"[fn:38] in his /Discours de la méthode/ (1637, Part IV).

There is a different philosophical tradition that arose in India approximately at the same time, Buddhism. One of its main concepts is the /theory of emptiness/ that states that "all things lack intrinsic reality, intrinsic objectivity, intrinsic identity or intrinsic referentiality" \cite[p. xvii]{Hixon:1993a}. While I have not read it anywhere, I do see a conceptual connection between the theory of emptiness and constructivism.

While \citeA[p. 184]{Denzin:2005c} claimed that the constructivist ontology is "relativist," but von \citeA[p. 4]{Glasersfeld:2000a} stated that constructivism is "without reference to ontology."  In my case I do not think that having a precise ontology is critical for my research. The `objects' of my study are `ideas through history.'  Except for a Platonist, no one, not even the most positivist realist is going to think that those ideas exist `somewhere' in the universe or elsewhere.

Axiology is the study of values \cite{Gough:2000a}, ethics \cite[p. 183]{Denzin:2005a}.  In the exact sciences it does not, at least explicitly, play any role.  In social sciences its status is disputed.  Positivist social sciences share with the exact sciences the claim that their research process is value-neutral \cite<e.g.>[Tables 8.2-4]{Guba:2005a}.  This is strongly disputed by social researchers that do not accept the positivist view of their research \cite{Howe:2009a}. It is impossible to do social research and not be concerned about values.  Kenneth \citeA{Howe:2009a} stated "Just as social research is theory-laden, it is also value-laden."  It is inescapable. After all, the statement "my research is value-neutral" is a value statement.

Looking at ethics from a professional point of view, my work will follow the /Standards for reporting on humanities-oriented research in AERA publications/ \cite{Barone:2009a}.  Having said that, I want to state that I completely agree with \citeA[p. 200]{Guba:2005a} that axiology is "part of the foundational philosophical dimensions of paradigm proposal."  My work intends to assist, even in small measure, the reader to recognize in mathematics education what Pierre Bourdieu calls /symbolic violence/ \cite{Sabour:1999a}, that the knowledge it produces is a product to be sold \cite[p. 4]{Lyotard:1984a}, and that what appears to be natural, normal, a fact of life, is actually a socially inculcated way of thinking. Thus, we can reclaim some of our freedom of action.

** STRT What is the Achievement Gap?					:sec:
#<<achieve-gap>>

It is better to speak about /Achievement Gap/ in the plural rather than in the singular.  In the literature there are references to the global \cite{Wagner:2008a} or international achievement gap (...), international achievement differences \cite{Stedman:1997a}, the national achievement gap (....), race gap \cite{Bali:2003a}, Black-White achievement gap \cite{Braun:2006a}, the teaching gap \cite{Stigler:2009a,Berry:2009a}, the preparation gap (....).  Usually, when we just refer to "achievement gap," the national one is intended \cite{Balfanz:2006a,Campbell:2005a,Cooper:2006a,DiGisi:2005a,Williams:2003a,Chubb:2002a}.  This can be noted from the following quote by \citeA[p. 333]{Maloney:2010a}.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The phrase "achievement gap" in education and political circles signifies the long-term and steady score gap between white, black, and Hispanic/Latino youth on standardized tests. Using the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and SAT scores, researchers have shown that this gap, first recognized in the 1960s, fell by 20% to 40% (depending on the estimate) in the 1970s and 1980s, but then began widening in the late 1990s (Lee 2002; English 2002; Haycock 2001).
#+END_QUOTE

However, others such as \cite{Downey:2009a} have a more nuanced view (p. 1):

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The first important step to take in confronting the achievement gap problem is to abandon the idea that one single thing, or even a few things in combination, will crack this apparently baffling educational conundrum.  And the first factor to confront is that there is no single "achievement gap" but many kinds of gaps. Using a national educational longitudinal data set, Carpenter Ramirez, and Severn (2006) found "not one but multiple achievement gaps, within and between groups" (p. 120) and "gaps between races may not be the most serious of them" (p. 123).
#+END_QUOTE

From a political orientation point of view, those who consider themselves to be liberal or socially progressive are more concerned with the national achievement gap (NAG), and those more conservative and business oriented are more interested in the international achievement gap (IAG).  We will now briefly look at the IAG.

*** STRT The International Achievement Gap

The international achievement gap is defined and understood in slightly different ways by various authors.  The general concept is that there exists a disparity (gap) between the proficiency of the students in USA and other countries that are considered its "peers."[fn:70]

A recent author on the subject, Tony \citeA[p. xxi]{Wagner:2008a}, defines this /Gap/ as the disparity between the "new skills" needed in "today's highly competitive global knowledge economy" and what the students are taught in class.

A more prosaic understanding of the gap is simply about the ranking of the US in international studies.  This is however a very crude way of understanding the issue.  Ranking is often misleading because the differences in score points are not statistically significant.

For example, the document that in a certain sense started it all, the /A Nation at Risk/ \cite{NCEE:1983a}[fn:17], was later re-analyzed and much less threatening results were found in the data. According to \citeA{Carson:1993a} the Simpson's paradox made several trends appear to go the opposite of their actual direction. This type of paradox occurs when the statistical data of distinct groups are pooled. That is, each group may exhibit a positive trend, but when combined the overall trend becomes negative. Most statisticians are aware of this paradox, but the layperson can easily be fooled by it[fn:18]. However, according to \citeA{Stedman:1993a} there were still reasons for concern even though the situation was not as dire as generally portrayed.  The standardized tests themselves have been subjected to extensive criticisms.  A simple renorming would make any idea of trends meaningless.

When the just the term /Achievement Gap/ is used, it generally refers to the National Achievement Gap (NAG).

It appears that the NAG is a phenomenon of the public school system [private schools?].  Home schooled students had comparable achievement scores across ethnic groups \cite[pp. 4--5]{HSLDA:2001a}.

** STRT Research Questions						:sec:
#<<res-questions>>

# GK: Need a little more of an intro here ##########################
Here I would like to condense the previous discussion about the funding of mathematics education vis-à-vis the achievement gaps into narrowly defined research questions.  The purpose for this process is to guide, to focus, and structure the process of investigation.  Hence, I have developed the following research questions

1. How has the attitude towards the public funding of the teaching of mathematics changed from neglect to the highest level of support of today?  What are (some of) the discontinuities in the history of ideas? How can these pivotal points be related to the economic, cultural, political, and military situation in that time and place?

2. What kinds of insights and understandings do the concepts of governmentality of Foucault, of hegemony of Gramsci, the sociological analyses of Pierre Bourdieu and Slavoj \v{Z}i\v{z}ek, and mythology of Barthes give us in the analysis of the discourses of political structures and organizations, educator organizations, businesses and their organizations, think tanks, and the military

3. What has been the role of the mathematicians and mathematics teachers themselves in the process of public funding?  How they have spoken and written to authorities and the literates of their society, first as individuals, then as members of professional societies and other organizations?

4. How have politicians described their motivations to publicly fund the teaching of mathematics?  What are the means, speeches, press releases, addresses to the nation and to meetings?  What kind of language is used?  To what type of logic and emotions do they appeal?

5. What is the role of large corporations as well as commercial organizations in encouraging financial support? How do they communicate their fears or aspirations? What is their logic, what do they appeal to?  To whom do they communicate, and how do they differentiate their discourse based on their audience?

# GK: You haven’t mentioned this in your introduction as a phenomenon either historically or contemporarily.
# DONE

6. Similarly to the previous entities, what is the role of the military in fostering the financial support of mathematics education? Has their discourse changed over time or has it been fairly constant?

** STRT Significance of the Study					:sec:
#<<significance>>

This study tries to understand the reasons given for the allocation by the government of large amounts of money for mathematics education.  The injunction for state support of education is present from the beginning of the literature on education. The first person known to have written on education was the Greek philosopher Plato. He presents his ideas on the instruction of children and young people in /The Republic/ (380 BCE) and /The Laws/ (355-347 BCE).[fn:8] There he affirmed the importance of the support by the state for the study of certain subjects. The justification for this financial support is that this kind of knowledge, at least among the ruling elite and military officers, is of vital national importance. Of course, it should be noted that in the Greece of that time the nation was equivalent to the city-state.[fn:43]

It should be noted that the socio-political program envisioned by /The Republic/ was never implemented in the Greek world.  It might even have been intended as an impossible allegory of what should be, but could not be.  It took many years for the idea of public support for schools to become reality.

Once this idea was accepted by society, it became more and more pervasive and it is inconceivable today to reverse its course.[fn:95] Even the most conservative of politicians, who would abolish the public school system, still advocate for some type of financial support, e.g. vouchers. All recent presidents and presidential candidates, governors and gubernatorial candidates, senators, congress members and so on, have made sweeping statements in support not only of public funding for education, but also to increase its level.  The situation today is that the funding per K-12 student in the USA is among the highest in the world \cite{OECD:2005a,OECD:2010a}.

By studying how society came to value the teaching of mathematics from total neglect to its privileged position today, I believe that we can obtain insights in the dynamics of today's mathematics funding and for its central place in the school curricula.

It has been noticed with dismay by many that none of the many educational reforms in education in general, and in mathematical education in particular, have ameliorated the supposedly dire situation in the nation's classrooms. Many have tried to untangle the many possible reasons for these failures and a wealth of remedies, corrections, improvements, and changes have been proposed.  I certainly do not pretend to have the right answer, or even *an* answer.  I do however intend to offer this study as a means to look at the problem from a different view point. I hope that its reading may spark some insight, some original way of examining these complex issues.

Some think that the school system, especially the *public* school system is apart or above politics. That it is an impartial system where all have the same opportunities. That it is a quintessential democratic, non-elitist, and egalitarian institution.  However, many have realized that this is not the case. During an interview of Michel Foucault and Noam Chomsky,[fn:9] Foucault said the following

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
But I think that the political power is also exerted by a few other institutions which seem to have nothing in common with the political power, which seem to be independent but which actually aren't. We all know that the universities and the whole educational system that apparently are supposed to distribute knowledge, we know that the educational system maintains the power in the hands of a certain social class and exclude the other social class from this power.

For example we can observe that the inequality in school achievement can not be completely explained by economic (financial) inequalities. Thus I had to invent a concept and call it "cultural capital."  That is the concept that we inherit from our family not only material means but also instruments of knowledge, of expression, of "savoir faire," modes and manners of work, for example, that are unconsciously transmitted by the family and that contribute enormously to the academic success.  That is because the school system requires without giving them to the students.  A simple example is work skills. I think that one for the greatest advantages of the children of intellectual categories in addition to that they hear in their families a language that is close to the language that is spoken in school, and that the school requires, is the fact that they have an attitude of relationship with culture very close to what is required in school and the fact that they receive from their families indications and encouragements concerning work and time management.  These things that apparently are of little importance, almost nothing, in reality are among the decisive factors that differentiate.  It is the art of work.  Schools give very little of this, because they do not have the time, and also because the teachers do not realize its importance.  The majority of the teachers are not aware that that is what is lacking. 

DB: The schools itself requires from the non-schooled.  

PB: Clearly, that is one of the extraordinary paradoxes that I have indicated in the first book that I have dedicated to education.  This is a teachers note in the margin of a page (student essay), which is hideous even though you do not think about it.  A teacher who wrote on the margin: "scolaire" (unimaginative).  

That means that the school system does not value what the school system itself transmits. It requires something else.  It does not consider sufficient what it gives.  

But if we say: this is the product of historical and social conditions such that you did not have easy access to the language that the school system requires.

We could obtain the idea that this system has intentions, that there is an evil will, a kind of evil, diabolic, perverse genie.  The worst is that these social mechanisms do not have a "will", they do not have a "subject" (des méchanismes, non des volontes). There is no conspiration. Unfortunately one of The wrong ways to understand sociology is to transform The analysis of The mechanisms into an analysis of will.

We say "it is The dominant class that eliminates..." That is a mistake that even sociologists make and those I criticize. The say "The school eliminates." That is not true.  It is The logic of The functioning of complicated mechanisms, there exists an unconscious in those mechanisms that determines that an certain kind of children are not by chance more eliminated than others.

School reforms fail because we look for those who are responsible, who are culpable.  In reality there are differential responsibilities that are most often responsibilities inscribed in The structures in a complicated manner that are above the capacity of the agents. That does not mean that The agents are not capable of doing something.  By becoming aware they can oppose these mechanisms, avoid to unconsciously serve them (Connaitre ce méchanisme et en enrayer l'éfficatité).

** STRT Scope of the Study						:sec:
#<<scope>>

# scope = delimitations

The work will consist of three parts. In the first one I will build a historical and theoretical framework of the relationship between the teaching and learning of mathematics and the perception of the benefit for the state of mathematical knowledge which manifests itself politically in a concrete support of the teaching of mathematics. This relationship should not be intended as claiming the existence of a cause and effect connection. More correctly it could be named "synchronicity." The second part will analyze public statements about the significance of the PISA and TIMSS mathematics scores for the state and future of the nation. The last part will be similar to the second, but with reference instead to the national, internal achievement gap.

This is a historical-critical investigation and not an experimental or even quasi-experimental one.  No causal claims are going to be proved, no correlations are going to be calculated, and no hypotheses are to be tested. I will examine a set of claims as made by politicians, educational experts, consulting organizations, and business leaders regarding the public funding of the teaching of mathematics.

* STRT Review of Literature				       :noexport:chp:
#<<lit-review>>

# RESEARCH AG-G
A vast amount of literature exists on the achievement gaps (AG), be it on mathematics, science, or reading, national or international. However, in this chapter I will refer only to academic publications and monographs.  Public and private entities have also produced a cornucopia of journal and newspaper articles and reports.  I will analyze non-academic literature later (chp. x). 

Part of the academic literature is about the achievement gaps in general (AG-G) and not about a specific subject and consists either of monographs \cite<e.g.>{Chubb:2002a,Murphy:2009b,Williams:2003a}, articles \cite<e.g.>{Levitt:2004a,Murphy:2009a,White:2009a}, or reports \cite<e.g.>{Kewal:2007a}.

There are studies that have focused on the national AG in general (NAG-G) and will thus examine NAEP scores, sometimes in combination with state standardized testing \cite<e.g.>{Linton:2003a}.  Other studies were performed on the international AG (IAG-G) and analyzed TIMSS and PISA data. Examples of such reports and articles are \citeA{Schmidt:1998a} and \citeA{Wang:2001a} on mathematics and science. Tony \citeA{Wagner:2008a} recently wrote a whole monograph on the IAG and proposed some remedies (chp. 6).

# RESEARCH AG-FUNDING
However, I have not been able to find any scholarly literature on the relationship of the AG and the funding of mathematics education.  We have to realize though that (1) the majority of revenue of public schools is of local origin, and (2) this local funding is not subject specific, but rather funds the schools and school districts /in toto/.  Most of the federal funding of public education comes through Title I \cite<see>{Borman:1996a,Candal:2009a}, and some from other funding agencies such as the NSF.  

# RESEARCH AG-M
There has been considerable interest in the investigation of the cause(s) of the mathematics AG (AG-M) \cite<e.g.>{Cooper:2006a}.  Often these studies use sophisticated statistical tools such as Binary Logistic Regression \cite{Balfanz:2006a}, Multivariate Analysis \cite{Bali:2003a,Bali:2004a}, Structural Equation Modeling \cite{Borman:2002a}, complex correlation and regression \cite{Rindermann:2009a}, or Hierarchical Linear Modeling \cite{Wenglinsky:2004a}.

# ELIMINATE
Also great effort has been expended on how to eliminate, or at least narrow the mathematics AGs through instructional levers, see \citeA{Balfanz:2006a,Candal:2009a,Miranda:2007a,Holloway:2004a,Wenglinsky:2004a,Berry:2009a,Haycock:2001a,DiGisi:2005a,Nathan:1983a,Johnson:2006a,Spielhagen:2006a,Spielhagen:2006b,Beecher:2008a,Glassman:1990a,Rothman:2001a,Rumberger:1992a,Treisman:2001a,Woodward:2006a}. 

Often the researchers will admit that they disregard the study of the causes due to the complexity of the analysis and thus it would not be reasonable to base instructional instruments on such uncertain conclusions \cite<see e.g.>{Singham:2003a}.  Some studies have found, however, that little can be done to reduce the NAG using educational levers \cite{Bali:2003a}.

Other studies focused on the positive or exemplary cases.  They studied schools that were considered successful, be they in the U.S.A. or abroad and tried to distill the characteristics that made them superior \cite{Barber:2007a}. Similarly, there is a series of studies that do not focus on the reason(s) for the AGs, but rather on how to eliminate them \cite{Spielhagen:2006b}.

# INEQUALITIES, SOCIAL, POLITICAL
A subset of these studies has focused on issues of inequities as chief cause and thus have a distinctively socio-political outlook, rather and an instructional-curricular one \cite{Braun:2006a}. In the case that these scholars will discuss instruction and curriculum not as a tool to address the problem, but rather as a cause for the AG (refs). 

# FUNDING
Some educational researchers will discuss funding of schools \cite{Borman:1996a}. Often insufficient funding is considered to be an important cause of the AG and its increase is thus an important instrument for its resolution \cite{Apple:1992a,Jordan:2003a,Payne:1999a}. Gloria \citeA{Ladson:2007a}, who investigated funding disparity, placed this issue among larger social variables such as health and wealth and thus uses the term "gap" for all of them.  It is understandable that any analysis of funding is inherently a political discourse.

A line of educational research is concerned with funding vis-à-vis equity rather than the AG /per se/. The unequal funding of schools in the USA has been the subject of educational research and some such as \citeA{Augenblick:1997a,Rebell:2008a} have made an oblique reference to an "educational adequacy", the emphasis has been on social justice and not the elimination of the NAG.  \cite{Augenblick:1997a,Kahle:1998a,Rebell:2008a}.  As we have seen, disparity of school funding is peculiar to the U.S.. Hence, equity is considered important in its own right as a constituent of a modern society which should be equitable.  However, it is generally accepted now that there is a strong relationship between what we could call the "funding gap" and the "achievement gap" and that low achievement is but a reflection of poor schools and it is well known that Hispanics and Afro-Americans reside disproportionately in poorer school districts. However, see \cite{Peevely:1999a} for contrasting evidence.

This line of thought is rejected by those who do not consider the cause of the AG to be due to resources, but rather to school practices \cite{Redding:1991a,Reeves:2003a,Singham:2003a}.

# BELIEFS
Another type of study is the investigation of beliefs, perspectives and attitudes of the teachers and school administrators on the AGs \cite{Bol:2005a,Carlyle:2009a}.  Even though their opinions are not based on any rigorous or critical examination of the data, they are valuable and informative \cite{Bol:2005a,Rousseau:2003a}.

# DOUBTING TESTING
Finally, some researchers seriously doubt the validity and usefulness of using standardized testing (NAEP, PISA, TIMMS) to gauge the AGs \cite[p. ?]{Carlyle:2009a,Rotberg:1998a}.  Others question the relationship between test scores and quality of education \cite{Chen:2010a}.

# SCHOOL REFORM
If we slightly shift our gaze from the AGs to a closely related issue, namely school reform, then we encounter some very interesting political analyses. For instance an incisive critique was presented by \citeA[p. xiii]{Gabbard:2000a} who wrote

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
To challenge the belief that a people's economic development proceeds in direct proportion to their level of educational achievement poses a threat of heresy against one of the most fundamental principles in modern secular theology. Precisely because education and development each implies a process resulting in some form of favorable change, we may properly speak of them as separate values. However, whereas education has a history of conceptual evolution separate from that of development, their evolutionary paths have since merged and congealed into one of the great and sacred certainties of our era. Nowhere, perhaps, has this belief taken stronger hold than in the United States, where the educational reform initiatives of the 1980s and 1990s have now elevated this belief to canonical status.
#+END_QUOTE

He continued his incisive critique with

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
At least two approaches present themselves for casting doubt on this sacred truism. The first entails an inquiry into the truthfulness of the claim. Since the National Commission on Excellence in Education released ''A Nation at Risk" in 1983, corporate elites and elected officials have orchestrated a massive propaganda campaign aimed at convincing the public that schools are, at once, the cause and the cure for their economic insecurity. In typical fashion, the media very obediently assisted in facilitating this fraud, helping to further entrench the belief that a people's economic development proceeds in direct proportion to their level of educational achievement. Not only has the media helped to spread this secular theology, it has also protected it from any serious public scrutiny by failing to report any of the most elementary facts that would call its presuppositions to question.[fn:98]
#+END_QUOTE

Gerald \citeA{Bracey:2003c} published an analysis that were very similar to Gabbard's. In the same book, Thomas \citeA{Popkewitz:2000a} provided discussion of school reform according to a Foucaultian prospective, Karen \citeA{Barnhardt:2000a} discussed the idea of "crisis" in US politics and culture, and Steve \citeA{Tozer:2000a} the concept of class that I find useful in my data analysis.  Seymour \citeA{Sarason:2003a} has also pointed out the "intractability of school reform" in his anthology. For instance he wrote (2003, p. 252)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
When over a period of time a condition has been intractable to efforts to improve it, it is a sure-fire sign that something is radically wrong with the assumptions on which our actions are based.
#+END_QUOTE

As I have shown previously (chp. 1.x) and will discuss more extensively later (chp. 4-5), rarely is the concept of class or income gap used.  However, some researchers have investigated the instructional situation of poor students \cite<see e.g.>{Mertens:2003a,Bracey:2002a}. 

# SCHOOL POLICY AND PHILOSOPHY
Finally, there are studies that approach the subject from a more distant viewpoint that are helpful in my investigations \cite<see e.g.>{Valero:2004a}. For instance, Joseph \citeA{Dunne:2005a} who wrote a chapter in \citeA{Carr:2005a} entitled "What's good of education?".  Joe \citeA{Kincheloe:1999a} wrote a political analysis describing how in U.S. workers made to be part of the economic systems through a variety of institutions, among which are the public schools and more specifically vocational schools. Jonathan \citeA{Kozol:1991a,Kozol:2006a} has written very critically about the public school system. Gloria \citeA{Ladson:2006a} discussed the AG and argued that we should instead focus on what she named the "education debt".  Kristi \citeA{Garrett:2009a} recently wrote that to really close the AGs it is imperative to talk about race.

Some researchers have done what I intend to do, that is the "problematization or the problematization" of the AGs \cite<see e.g.>{Martin:2003a,Bracey:1998a,Bracey:2003a,Bracey:2003b,Bracey:2003c}.  

Sometimes even those who only invoke the use of instructional tools will have to engage in political discourse.  For instance, often Charter Schools are presented as a solution because they offer instructional flexibility and can thus, according to their proponents, adapt to the needs of low-achieving students \cite{Nathan:1983a}.  Evidently, support of charter schools is a political stance.  Some, less trusting, scholars have stated that an appeal to educational changes is but a thinly veiled disguise for a political agenda be it more "liberal" or "conservative" \cite{Bracey:2003c}.

# POLITICO-SOCIAL knowledge/teaching mathematics 
Another interesting field of study in mathematics education is the politico-social function of the knowledge of mathematics and the drives in teaching it \cite{Namukasa:2004a,Walshaw:2004a}.  In the examination of the political dimensions of mathematics education I find very useful the use of a concept introduced by Michel Foucault called /governmentality/.  I will write later in more detail about it (see chp. 5).  There are a few researchers who have used this concept in education research such as \citeA{Doherty:2006a}, \citeA{Peters:2009a}, and \citeA{Popkewitz:2007a}.

Advancing a three-fold political agenda, this volume: * illuminates how the meanings assigned to a whole vocabulary of words and phrases frequently used to discuss the role and reform of U.S. public schools reflect an essentially economic view of the world; * contends that education or educational reform conducted under an economized worldview will only intensify the effects of the colonial relations of political and economic domination that it breeds at home and abroad; and * offers a set of alternative concepts and meanings for reformulating the role of U.S. public schools and for considering the implications of such a reformulation more generally for the underlying premises of all human relationships and activities. Toward these ends, the authors, in Part I, critically examine many of the most commonly used terms within the rhetoric of educational reform since the early 1980s and before. Part II links today's economized worldview to curricular and educational issues. These essays are especially important for comprehending how the organization of school curriculum privileges those disciplines deemed most central to market expansion--math and science--and how the political centrality of the economic sphere influences the nature of the knowledge presented in specific content areas. Given that language constrains as well as advances human thought, the twin tasks of de-economizing education and decolonizing society will require a vocabulary that transcends the familiar terminologies addressed in Parts I and II. The entries in Part III cultivate the beginnings of such a vocabulary as the authors elucidate innovative concepts which they view as central to the creation of truly alternative educational visions and practices.

The mastery of reason. New York: Routledge.

Research by Walkerdine (1988), often cited  but systematically ignored within the constructivist pedagogy literature, empirically explores how child-centered pedagogies discursively create a normalized vision of the "natural child and what is "true." The emphasis on verbalization and justification in the constructivist teaching, she argues, relates to particular /habitus/ that embody bourgeois and gendered conceptions. While the ideas of "problem solving" and "community" seem unambiguous and naturally "good" in constructivist research, they can become dangerous when presented as universal principles without social mooring.

Cultural History and Education brings together an outstanding group of the leading scholars in the study of the cultural history of education. These scholars, whose work represents a variety of national contexts from throughout Europe, Latin America, and North America, contribute to a growing body of work that seeks to re-think historical studies in education by integrating the study of knowledge systems, otherwise known as "discourses," into traditional intellectual history. This groundbreaking volume challenges the field of historical studies in education to move away from the historicism that still dominates it, and thus introduces new ways to think about the politics of knowledge and the problems of change and reform in education. By understanding how knowledge gives rise to particular constructs of "the child," "the teacher," "the school," and "the community," the essays open up space for critique and other possibilities of action.

Edition: 5, illustrated. Published by Springer. ISBN 1402079060, 9781402079061. 277 pages

This book examines mathematics education research from socio-political perspectives. It is organised in dialogic units which examine issues such as the critique of existing research results based on the adoption of socio-political approaches; the implications of alternative theoretical tools in researching mathematics education; the tensions emerging while conducting research in highly conflictive environments; the researchers' positioning with respect to research participants; and the adoption of socio-political methodological frameworks. As a whole, the book serves to illuminate what it means to say that power is a central constituent of mathematics education practices and research.

"Critical theories in education: changing terrains of knowledge and politics" Published by Routledge, 1999. ISBN 0415922402, 9780415922401. 254 pages

This book examines critical theories in education research from various points of view in order to critique the relations of power and knowledge in education and schooling practices. It addresses social injustices in the field of education, while at the same time questioning traditional standards of critical theory. Drawing on recent social and literary criticism, this collection identifies conversations across disciplines that address the theoretical and methodological challenges in educational debate. Critical Theories in Education offers a rethinking of Marxist theories of education, joining issues of teaching and pedagogy with issues of the state and economy, social movements, literary criticism, pragmatism and postcolonialism.

Some authors have discussed the disconnect that the modern "western" mind has for ideology because it can not detect its mythical aspects (M. Eliade, /Myths, Dreams and Mysteries/).


Manifest destiny + American Progress.

Roland \citeA[p. 109]{Barthes:1972a} here gives one of the many possible definitions of myth stating that "myth is a type of speech," but is obviously "not /any/ type."  It is not "an object, a concept, or an idea," it is a "message." or a "mode of signification, a form."

The author extends the terminology of de Saussure from signified -> signifier to signified -> signifier -> signification.

What is the content of this message, or better how do we understand the message?  The meaning of this message "has its own value, it belongs to a history", "it postulates a kind of knowledge, a past, a memory, a comparative order of facts, ideas, decisions." (p. 117). This historical and contextual aspect of a myth is the cause of its "instability".  That is, myths "come into being, alter, disintegrate, disappear completely."  Thus a certain myth will only to a certain group of readers and not to another group (p. 119). Another interesting aspect of a myth is that it can have more, many more, than just one signifiers (p. 120).

======================================================
Although we are not necessarily aware of it, modern myths are created with a reason. As in the example of the red wine, mythologies are formed to perpetuate an idea of society that adheres to the current ideologies of the ruling class and its media.

Barthes demonstrates this theory with the example of a front cover from Paris Match, showing a young black soldier in French uniform saluting. The signifier: a saluting soldier, cannot offer us further factual information of the boy's life. But it has been chosen by the magazine to symbolise more than the boy; the picture, in combination with the signifieds of Frenchness, militariness, and relative ethnic difference, gives us a message about the French Empire and its citizens. The picture does not explicitly demonstrate 'that France is a great empire, that all her sons, without any colour discrimination, faithfully serve under her flag,' etc., but the combination of the signifier and signified perpetuates the myth of imperial devotion, success and thus; a property of 'significance' for the picture.

signified -> signifier -> significance

In writing about the process of mythologization, Barthes refers to the tendency of socially constructed notions, narratives, and assumptions to become "naturalized" in the process, that is, taken unquestioningly as given within a particular culture. Barthes finishes Mythologies by looking at how and why mythologies are built up by the bourgeoisie in its various manifestations. He returns to this theme in later works including The Fashion System.

The work of Claude Lévi-Strauss, and his investigations into ideology and how it is controlled by the state, should also be considered in this context.

# GK: Since I have proposed changing the title of this section, I also suggest that the following methodologies be introduced in terms of having as your objectives to use these particular methods and perspectives. Maybe you need a separate section here titled something like Definitions and Assumptions? ===== MOVE to Methodology

Briefly, the study is an archival-historical research project. I have found it easier to discuss my methodology by starting with the methods that I have chosen.  The type of research determines the methods. The methods of an archival-historical project are text and discourse analysis.  I will examine statements by politicians, political and professional organizations, corporations and think tanks.  These statements are in the form of reports, press releases, web articles and quotations and interviews by journalists of the above mentioned entities. The medium will be printed or electronic.  The form will be written or video.  In the case of spoken statements I will prepare transcripts.

My paradigmatic standpoint in this research project is eminently qualitative. However, I may also use some quantitative methods as a supplementary investigation as it is now possible to do statistical analysis of texts. I briefly describe this type of analysis below ([[Statistical Text Analysis]]).

Returning to qualitative research, I do consider myself as engaging in what is called /bricolage/ as described by \citeA[p. 4--6]{Denzin:2005b}. Indeed, I understand myself to be a /bricoleur/, a "jack of all-trades, a kind of professional do-it-yourself" (p. 4). The authors wrote (pp. 4--6)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
There are many kinds of /bricoleurs/ -- interpretative, narrative, theoretical, political, methodological \ldots The interpretative /bricoleur/ produces a bricolage -- that is, a pieced-together set of representations that is fitted to the specifics of a complex situation \ldots Its choice of practice, that is, is pragmatic, strategic and self-reflexive \ldots deploying whatever strategies, methods, and empirical materials are at hand \ldots

Qualitative research is inherently multimethod in focus \ldots Objective reality can never be captured. We know a thing only through its representations. \ldots The combination of multiple methodological practices, empirical materials, perspectives, and observers in a single study is best understood, then, as a strategy that adds rigor, breadth, complexity, richness, and depth to any inquiry.

The methodological /bricoleur/ is adept at performing a large number of diverse tasks \ldots The theoretical /bricoleur/ reads widely and is knowledgeable about the many interpretative paradigms (\ldots) that can be brought to any particular problem. \ldots one cannot easily move between paradigms as overarching philosophical systems denoting particular ontologies, epistemologies, and methodologies. \ldots Perspectives, in contrast, are less well developed systems, and one can move between them more easily. The researcher as /bricoleur/-theorist works between them and within competing and overlapping perspectives and paradigms.  The interpretative /bricoleur/ understands that research is an interactive process shaped by his or her own personal history, biography, gender, social class, race, and ethnicity, and by those of the people in the setting. The critical /bricoleur/ stresses the dialectical and hermeneutic nature of interdisciplinary inquiry, \ldots  The political /bricoleur/ knows that science is power, for all research findings have political implications. There is no value-free science.

Thus, as a /bricoleur/ I find most useful for the type of research that I intend to perform the theoretical concept of /governmentality/ by Foucault (refs) in conjunction with the neo-Gramscian concept of hegemony (refs).

# The research paradigm of a historian

Our minds can not but operate according to a more or less coherent set of beliefs about who we are, where we are, and what we interact with \cite[p. 183]{Denzin:2005a}.  We can also call it an axiomatic system \cite[p. 192]{Guba:2005a} or a net of premises \cite[p. 22]{Denzin:2005b}. Researchers during their day to day activities are mostly concerned with their research methods.  The methods are the source of the "stuff" their work consists of.  However, methods are conceptually at the lowest level of a series of linked concepts that increase in abstractness as we move up from methods to methodology, epistemology, ontology, and lastly axiology. For a recent and thorough discussion of paradigms in education see \citeA{Howe:2009a,Howe:2009b}, \citeA{Johnson:2009a}, \citeA{Bredo:2009a}, and \citeA{Tillman:2009a}. 

Education researchers operate according to a variety of paradigms.  However, the main two are positivist/post-positivist and constructivist.  According to \citeA[p. 44]{Merriam:1991a} the positivist worldview assumes "a single, objective reality - the world out there - that we can observe, know, and measure."  While  \citeA[p. 184]{Denzin:2005c} state that axioms of constructivism are "relativist ontology (relativism)," "transactional epistemology," and "hermeneutic, dialectical methodology."

In order to identify the paradigm that frames my work, I would like to proceed inductively, by moving `upward' from methods all the way up to axiology, and by analyzing each axiomatic component according to the classification provided by \citeA[p. 192]{Guba:2005a} and \citeA{Gough:2000a}. However, we should note that \citeA{Guba:2005a} wrote that the "boundaries between paradigms are shifting" (p. 197).

** STRT Methods								:sec:
#<<methods>>

While often `method' and `methodology' are confused or used synonymously, Harding (as cited in \citeNP{Gough:2000a}) stated that

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A research /method/ is a technique for (or a way of proceeding in) gathering evidence.  One could reasonable argue that all-evidence gathering techniques fall into one of the following three categories: *listening to (or interrogating) informants*, *observing behaviour*, or *examining historical traces and records*.  In this sense, there are only three methods of social inquiry.[fn:35]
#+END_QUOTE

Obviously, in my case the only method that will be used is the third one, /examining historical traces and records/. I will call it /text analysis/ with the understanding that I am mostly examining written texts, which I will supplement with a few audiovisual material. Thus, that is my *data*, these /traces and records/. What kind of documents are they, and what are their sources?  They are presented in the following section.

** STRT Data analysis							:sec:
#<<data-analysis>>

The use of Deconstruction in textual analysis.

John Knight, Richard Smith, and Judith Sachs "Deconstructing hegemony: Multicultural policy and a populist response", pp. 133-152, Chapter 7 of "Foucault and Education: Disciplines and Knowledge" Stephen J. Ball editor, 1990, Routledge.

The chapter is about competing texts, "the critical appreciation of official state policies. Such policies attempt to represent the world in factual terms so that certain kinds of practices flow 'naturally' from them.  They appropriate scientific methodologies and social science theory in order to create a reality that is rational, objective, seamless, and which taps into the sensibilities of national popular consciousness.  In doing so, such policies tell stories which, once interpreted by its audiences, are emptied of meaning and filled with available social myths (Barthes, 1973), p. 133. Competing stories are thus available as resources for decoding and recoding and otherwise clashing or collaborating with official policy.

They analyze these apparently conflicting texts and discover that they have the same ideological assumptions and have the same political goals.

Only when the 'official' authority of the text as knowledge and its source as guarantor of its truth are transcended, can the construction of really useful knowledge begin. (p. 149).

"However, in seeking an understanding not only of the operations of the Right's discursive ensemble but also of its broader social consequences, a Foucaultian analysis has its limitations.  It is my contention that, in this instance at least, Foucault is usefully complemented by a post-structuralist reading of Gramsci and it therefore my intention here to draw from both in analysing this particular historical moment." Jane \citeA[p. 172]{Kenway:1990a}.

** STRT Statistical Text Analysis					:sec:
#<<text-mining>>

Informatics can be a very useful tool in textual analysis.  \citeA{Monroe:2008a} discussed the use of statistical analysis of political texts. This kind of analysis is commonly called /text mining/. There are many statistical packages capable of performing text mining that one can choose from.  For practical and ideological reasons I have chosen the open source /R/ data analysis application.[fn:76]  /R/ is free, actively developed and thus frequently updated, it possesses many, many additional libraries for just about any possible statistical application and is very popular in statistical departments.  On the downside, the system is difficult to use and is not as popular in the 'soft' sciences as it is in the 'hard' sciences.

The main statistical analyses of text mining done by /R/ are /count-based evaluation/, /term correlations/, /simple text clustering/, /hierarchical clustering/, and /text classification/.  One can consult \citeA{Feinerer:2008a,Feinerer:2008b,Feinerer:2008c} for an explanation of these terms as well as for examples of this type of analysis performed in the /R/ data analysis application \cite{R-project:2010a,Feinerer:2010a}.

An interesting public document is one by President George W. Bush where he introduces NCLB as a proposal (ref??).  The document promises an increase in funding for needy schools and districts (pp. 1-2), charter schools (pp. 5, 18), teacher training (pp. 6, 12--13), disabled students (p. 27), educational technology (pp. 4, 22), and English language (pp. 4, 11, 16), character education (p. 21), and school safety (p. 6, 20). The mathematics international (p. 1) and national (p. 16) achievement gaps are pointed out, but its teaching will be "strengthened through math and science partnerships" with institutes of higher education (p. 6, 14, 15). However, it will be rigorously assessed (p. 7, 8--9) for its high standards (p. 7, 15, 27). Its teachers may receive higher pay (p. 13) and states that implement its assessment can receive a one-time bonus (p. 28).

*** STRT Description of my historical methodology

I do not pretend to give a comprehensive history of this subject. It will be quite a selective narration. However, I will as the King instructed the White Rabbit in /Alice in Wonderland/,[fn:16] "Begin at the beginning," which is ancient Sumeria, move to Greece, Western Europe and end in the USA.  I am forced to omit ancient Egypt and the Arabic-Persian civilization of the Middle Age. Why?  There is a very practical reason, its is preferable to read the text in its original language and I am able to read the European languages in which the most significant texts were written.  I am also of the opinion that all the major discourses on the subject at hand have been written in Europe.  If I am accused of "Eurocentrism", so be it.

My view of history is greatly influenced by the French post-structuralists, especially Michel Foucault.  I share his view of history as ....

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

#+END_QUOTE

It is possible to discern a "fil rouge", however.  In my opinion that is because over the long run and at least in Western Europe, societies became more and more technologically complex and many have seen a close relationship between technology and the societal need of mathematical knowledge.

Schools have existed since the dawn of civilization in Sumeria and *both* writing and mathematics were part of the curriculum.  However, they were not publicly funded and thus were in effect schools for the elite.  During the late middle ages in Italy there were schools that were funded by the local municipal government through taxation, but still they were for the elite, those actually being taxed, so "the right hand gave and the left hand took."  

The first time that the state funds education is in Prussia in 1171 with the Volksschule. However, in often another type of state funded school system in which mathematics is the cornerstone of the curriculum are the military academies.

*** STRT Mesopotamia

The first historical evidence for a school system is in ancient Sumeria where children of the ruling class were sent to the local temple or palace school, called "e.du.ba", to learn writing and mathematics \cite[p. 25]{Thomason:2005aa}.

*** STRT Ancient Greece

The most ancient document in existence that deals with, among other subjects, education is The Republic of Plato (380 BC). Interestingly it enjoins universal compulsory teaching for both girls and boys paid by the state. Nonetheless, mathematics was not among the disciplines to be taught. The curriculum consisted only of music and gymnastics.  That does not mean that Plato did not mention mathematics in The Republic, on the contrary. In addition many of his statements about the learning of mathematics appear very contemporary

The first time in known history that an author wrote on education was by Plato in his two political treatises, /The Republic/ (380 BCE) and /Laws/ \cite[p. 100]{Harris:1991aa}. The first book \cite{Adam:1902aa} is much better known than the second \cite{Plato:1968aa}, however, his recommendation for universal education is actually in his later work

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[7.804c] \ldots we have described buildings for the public gymnasia as well as schools in three divisions within the city, and also in three divisions round about the city training-grounds and race-courses for horses, arranged for archery and other long-distance shooting, and for the teaching and practicing of the youth: if, however, our previous description of these was inadequate, let them now be described and legally regulated.  In all these establishments there should reside teachers [7.804d] attracted by pay from abroad for each several subject, to instruct the pupils in all matters relating to was and to music; and not father shall either send his son as a pupil or keep him away from the training-school at his own sweet will, but every ``man jack'' of them all (as the saying goes) must, so far as possible, be compelled to be educated, inasmuch as they are children of the State even more than children of their parents. \textbf{For females, too}, my law will lay down the same regulations as for men, and training of an identical kind.
#+END_QUOTE

In the above passage we should notice the mentioning of the concept of competitive pay for teachers. In the same dialogue we also have injunctions for the implementation of a form of school administration

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[6.764c] \ldots It will be proper next to appoint officials for music and gymnastics, two grades for each department, the one for education, the other for managing competitions.  By education-officers the law means supervisors of gymnasia and schools, both in respect of their discipline [6.764d] and teaching and of the control of the attendances and accommodations both for girls and boys.

#+END_QUOTE

In /The Republic/ the passages relevant to education are presented as a fictitious conversation between Glaucon and Socrates (as a stand-in for Plato himself). They discuss, among others, the concepts of curriculum, motivations for learning mathematics, support by the state, and economic, cultural and military aspects of mathematics knowledge. Here Glaucon said

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[7.522b] "Surely; and yet what other study is left apart from music, gymnastics and the arts?" "Come," said I, "if we are unable to discover anything outside of these, let us take [7.522c] something that applies to all alike." "What?" "Why, for example, this common thing that all arts and forms of thought and all sciences employ, and which is among the first things that everybody must learn." "What?" he said.  "This trifling matter," I said, "of distinguishing on and two and three. I mean, in sum, number and calculation. Is it not true of them that every art and science must necessarily partake of them?" "Indeed it is," he said. "The art of war too?" said I. "Most necessarily," he said.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[7.525b] \ldots "And the qualities of number appear to lead to the apprehension of truth." "Beyond anything," he said. "Then, as it seems, these would be among the studies we are seeking. For a soldier must learn them in order to marshal his troops, and a philosopher, because he must rise out of the region of generation and lay hold on essence or he can never become a true reckoner." "It is so," he said. "And our guardian is soldier and philosopher in one." "Of course." "It is befitting, then, Glaucon, that this branch of learning should be prescribed by our law and that we should induce those who are to share the highest function of state [7.525] to enter upon that study of calculation and take hold of it, not as amateurs, but to follow it up until they attain to the contemplation of the nature of number, by pure thought, not for the purpose of buying and selling, as if they were preparing to be merchants or hucksters, but for the uses of war and for facilitating the conversion of the soul itself from the world of generation to essence and truth."

Why study geometry:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[7.527c]  "Then nothing is surer," said I, "than that we must require that the men of your Fair City shall never neglect geometry, for even the by-products of such study are not slight." "What are they?" said he. "What you mentioned," said I, "its uses in war, and also we are aware that for the better reception of all studies there will be immeasurable difference between the student who has been imbued with geometry and the one who has not." "Immense indeed, by Zeus," he said. "Shall we, then, lay this down as a second branch of study for our lads?" "Let us do so, he said. \ldots [7.522e] "Shall we not then," I said, "set down as a study requisite for a soldier the ability to reckon and number?" "Most certainly, if he is to know anything whatever of the ordering of his troops - or rather if he is to be a man at all." (cf. Laws 819d)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[7.526b] \ldots "Again, have you ever noticed this, that natural reckoners are by nature quick in virtually all their studies? And the slow, if they are trained and drilled in this, even if no other benefit results, all improve and become quicker than they were?" "It is so," he said [7.526c] "And, further, as I believe, studies that demand more toil in the learning and practice than this we shall not discover easily nor find many of them." "You will not in fact." "Then, for all these reasons, we must not neglect this study, but must use it in the education of the best endowed natures." "I agree," he said \ldots

[7.528b] \ldots "but this subject, Socrates, does not appear to have been investigated yet."

And secondly, the investigators need a director, who is indispensable for success and who, to begin with, is not easy to find, and then, if he could be found, as things are now, seekers in this field would be too arrogant. [7.528c] to submit to his guidance. But if the state as a whole should join in superintending these studies and honor them, these specialists would accept advice, and continuous and strenuous investigation would bring out the truth.  Since even now, lightly esteemed as they are by the multitude and hampered by the ignorance of their students as to the true reasons for pursuing them, they nevertheless in the face of all these obstacles force their way by their inherent charm [7.528d] and if would not surprise us if the truth about them were made apparent." \ldots [7.528e] "assuming that this science" \ldots "is available, provided that is, that the state pursues it.

#+END_QUOTE

The other great philosopher of that time, \citeA{Aristotle:1944aa}, discussed education in the context of a political treatise called /Politics/, just as Plato did. However, his approach was much more practical and much less Utopian. He did write about the importance of the involvement of the state in education and some form of universal education
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[8.1337a] Now nobody would dispute that the education of the young requires the special attention of the lawgiver.  Indeed the neglect of this in states is injurious to their constitutions; for education ought to  be adapted to the particular form of constitution, \ldots And as much as the end for the whole state is one, it is manifest that education also must necessarily be one and the same for all and that the superintendence of this must be public, and not on private lines, in the way in which at present each man superintends the education of his own children, teaching them privately, and whatever special branch of knowledge he thinks fit. But matters of pubic interest ought to be under public supervision; at the same time we ought not to think that any of the citizens belongs to himself, but that all belong to the state, for each is a part of the state, and it is natural for the superintendence of the several parts to have regard to the superintendence of the whole.  And one might praise the Spartans in respect of this, for they pay the greatest attention to the training of their children, and conduct it on a public system.
#+END_QUOTE

Then Aristotle discussed about the legislation of education and mentions conflicting ideas about the curriculum in his time.  He also tells us about the curriculum that "There are perhaps four customary subjects of education, reading and writing, gymnastics, music, and fourth, with some people, drawing; \ldots" (8.1337b)

Aristotle makes reference to an, otherwise unknown, Phaleas of Chalcedon, who considered "it fundamentally necessary for states to have equality in these two things, property and education."  Then Aristotle discusses the connection between education and property and their inequalities among the people (1266b).

He also seems to have supported the teaching of both sexes, again for political reasons
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[1260b] \ldots For since every household is part of a state \ldots it is necessary that the education both of the children and of the women should be carried on with a regard to the form of constitution, \ldots
#+END_QUOTE

It is interesting to note that Aristotle considers education important for women because they "are a half of the free population," (1260b).  It has been noted that today's patriarchal societies waste half of their human resources and how in a globally competing world this is hurting the economy of those countries.

After reading these quotes on education written about 2,400 years ago, one may think that almost everything there is to say about education was written then.  We have discussions about curricula, school ages, school support, obligatory education for all,and the need for state regulation.  With special reference for mathematics, Plato proposes state support for research, and stresses the great relevance of education for the state of morality, intellectual development, and the economic and military vitality of the state. He also cautions the reader acknowledging that it is the most difficult subject, and should not be taught against the wishes of the student.

Reality was much different. \citeA{Xenophon:1979aa} wrote in his /Memorabilia/ (371 BCE) that in his time education was responsibility of the parents, who may send their children to a teacher "at a cost, and strive their utmost that the children may turn out as well as possible." (2.2.6).  There was then no universal education and there will not be for two millennia. It took only slightly less time to have state support of education.

We have to keep in mind that in The Republic the characters of Socrates and his interlocutors, such as Glaucon, are literary devices for the author, Plato.  Also, those who will receive the highest form of education, which includes mathematics, are the philosopher-kings, the ruling elite. In addition, the study of mathematics has two purposes, intellectual and military. There is no idea that mathematics is useful for technology, business, or engineering.

For instance in Book VI he shows the use of mathematics as an intellectual device, a way of logical reasoning.  However, The Republic is not always consistent in this.  Plato wrote that mathematics is

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"\ldots of universal application."
"A something which all arts and sciences and intelligences use in common, and which every one first has to learn among the elements of education."

Socrates: "Can we deny that a warrior should have knowledge of arithmetic?"

Glaucon: "Certainly he should, if he is to have the smallest understanding of military tactics, or indeed, I should rather say, if he is to be a man at all."

\ldots

Socrates: "Then this is a kind of knowledge which legislation may fitly prescribe; and we must endeavor to persuade those who are prescribed to be the principal men of our State to go and learn arithmetic, not as amateurs, but they must carry on the study until they see the nature of numbers with the mind only; nor again, like merchants or retail-traders, with a view to buying or selling, but for the sake of their military use, and of the soul herself; and because this will be the easiest way for her to pass from becoming to truth and being."

"That is excellent, he (Glaucon) said."

Socrates: "Yes, I said, and now having spoken of it, I must add how charming the science is! and in how many ways it conduces to our desired end, if pursued in the spirit of a philosopher, and not of a shopkeeper!

How do you mean?

I mean, as I was saying, that arithmetic has a very great and elevating effect, compelling the soul to reason about abstract number, and rebelling against the introduction of visible or tangible objects into the argument.

And, for all these reasons, arithmetic is a kind of knowledge in which
the best natures should be trained, and which must not be given up.

I agree.

Let this then be made one of our subjects of education."

Then Plato explains how geometry should be given the save value as arithmetic. Again, he states that officers of the army should know geometry.  However, he thinks that only little is necessary. For every-day practical uses not much mathematics is required according to Plato. Today's situation is not very different. Plato wants the elite to know much more mathematics due to its abstract and intellectual nature.  That is the kind of intellect and knowledge that the ruling class should have.

"That the knowledge at which geometry aims is knowledge of the eternal, and not of aught perishing and transient."

But Plato grants that mathematics has indirectly positive practical effects on society. Nonetheless, he goes back to the notion of mathematical knowledge for the fostering of ones intelligence.

"Then nothing should be more sternly laid down than that the inhabitants of your fair city should by all means learn geometry.  Moreover the science has indirect effects, which are not small."

"There are the military advantages of which you spoke, I said; and in
all departments of knowledge, as experience proves, any one who has
studied geometry is infinitely quicker of apprehension than one who has not."

Then follows a very interesting discussion about the curriculum, what the order of study of subjects should be.  Plato proposes the sequence 'plane geometry' - 'solids of revolution' - 'solid geometry' - 'astronomy'  This is based on concepts of difficulty as well as prerequisites.

After that is a most interesting statement about state support of mathematics research which will determine the status of advanced mathematics and thus increase the desire among people to learn it. Plato states that these more advanced subjects would arise

"although none of their votaries can tell the use of them, still these studies .... if they had the help of the State, they would some day emerge into light."

"And have you further observed, that those who have a natural talent for calculation are generally quick at every other kind of knowledge; and even the dull if they have had an arithmetical training, although they may derive no other advantage from it, always become much quicker than they would otherwise have been.

And indeed, you will not easily find a more difficult study, and not
many as difficult.

And, for all these reasons, arithmetic is a kind of knowledge in which
the best natures should be trained, and which must not be given up.

Let this then be made one of our subjects of education."

*** STRT Renaissance

The Greek civilization became the Hellenistic civilization and then the Roman/Hellenistic civilization.  Afterwards civilization in Europe would be mostly confined to the Byzantine Empire and the lands conquered by the Arabs (Andalus and Sicily).  There were schools in Europe, of course, but education did usually not include mathematics.  Usually the curriculum consisted only of the Latin language and some Latin literature \cite[p. 1]{Black:2001aa}.  The first stirrings of change in the condition of mathematics education occurred in Italy during the thirteenth century. Commerce brought Italian merchants in contact with the much more civilized Near East and North Africa. Leonardo of Pisa published in 1202 his /Liber Abaci/ that popularized the Indian system of numeration in Italy and then the rest of Europe. The new number system was soon adopted by the Italian merchants \cite[pp. 128--151]{Smith:1911aa}. At the same time we have the development of the modern banking system starting with the "Monte dei Paschi" of Siena.[fn:23]  Finally, the modern double-entry accounting system came into general use in Italy \cite<e.g.>{Smith:1951aa}.

Private schools were created that were devoted to the teaching of mathematics for the sons of merchants and bankers.  They were called the "abbaco," the abacus school. The curriculum today would be described as `business mathematics.' The main textbook was the /Trattato d'Abbaco/ by Piero della Francesca.[fn:20] Not only business people were trained in these schools, but also architects, painters, and artisans.  For instance Machiavelli and Leonardo da Vinci went to the abacus school \cite[p. 19]{Gamba:1989kx}. Nicoló Tartaglia was a teacher at an abacus school in Verona.[fn:21] There was no public support for these schools and neither was it universal education, but a whole new social class was sending all their sons to these schools with the result that mathematics knowledge increased greatly in society.

The important factor, in my opinion, is that from here on the ruling class slowly becomes aware of the importance of mathematics for the wealth and defense of the country.  In Italy it happened quickly because most governments were directly controlled by the business class. The governments in the rest of Europe were still in the hands of the nobles who worried about the business class mostly when they had to borrow money to finance their wars or raise taxes.

A famous Renaissance mathematician and mathematics teacher, Niccolò Fontana "Tartaglia" (1499-1557) There is a story that Tartaglia learned only half the alphabet from a private tutor before funds ran out, and he had to learn the rest for himself.

From book 6, question 8.  We have an imaginary conversation between the author who answers questions posed by a contemporary of his, the Prior of Barletta.

P. Che fu vostro precettore. N. Avanti, che mio padre morisse, fui mandato al quanti mesi a scola di leggere, ma perche à quel tempo io ra molto piccolo, cioe di eta de anni cinque in sei, no me aricordo el nome di tal maestro, vero è, che essendo poi di eta di anni 14. uel circa.

The book itself was dedicated to Henry VIII king of England and the first edition was published in 1546.

"Latin education was the foundation stone of medieval and Renaissance Italian culture. The learning of the Latin language and the introduction to Latin literature were the principal preoccupations of schools throughout the middle ages and Renaissance: indeed, until the rise of abacus or commercial arithmetic schools in the thirteenth and especially fourteenth centuries, and before the introduction of Greek into the school curriculum in the fifteenth century, no subject other than Latin was studied at the lower stages of the educational hierarchy \cite[p. 1]{Black:2001aa}.

Lezione di geometria, dipinto di anonimo, sec. XVI, Collezione privata Pesaro, "Galileo Galilei e gli scienziati del ducato di Urbino" Catalogo della mostra a cura di Enrico Gamba e Vico Montebelli, 1989, Edizioni QuattroVenti Snc, Urbino, p. 19

Il dipinto illustra efficacemente i modi d'insegnamento nel Medioevo e Rinascimento.
Il maestro si serve di un cartello sul quale sono illustrati gli enti geometrici: linea, angolo, ...; nelle scuole d'abaco altri cartelli illustravano le addizioni, divisioni, moltiplicazioni tra numeri, analogamente all nostra tavola pitagorica.
Le scuole non evavano in dotazione banchi, gli allievi sedevano su panche o addirittura stavano in piedi.  Gli allievi non possedevano libri e quaderni, gran parte delle nozioni erano tenute a memoria.  L'insegnamento non si basava sulla teoria, ma su problemi ed operazioni concrete come dimostrano i compassi tenuti in mano dagli allievi.
Le scuole d'abaco si affermano in Italia a partire dal Duecento sull'onda della rivoluzione commerciale.  Il loro scopo era di trasmettere le nozioni matematiche necessarie nella pratica mercantile: costi, cambi, interessi, leghe, ecc.  Nelle scuole d'abaco s'insegnavano anche le nozioni geometriche indispensabili per l'agrimensura e l'edilizia.
Durante il Trecento e Quattrocento le scuole d'abaco si diffondono rapidamente in tutta l'Italia divenendo, insieme all'apprendistato in bottega, il luogo di formazione non solo dei futuri mercanti, am di architetti, pittori, artigiani, tecnici civili e militari.  Famosi personaggi come Machiavelli e Leonardo da Vinci frequentarono la scuola d'abaco.
Dal punto di vista della storia delle scienze la scuola d'abaco è l'istituzione che fino a tutto il Cinquecento fornisce il maggior apporto alla diffusione di conoscenze matematiche in vasti strati sociali.

Una significativa allegoria del sapere matematico: Nicolò Tartaglia, La Nova Scientia con una gionta al terzo libro, Venezia 1558, presso Curzio Troiano (Prima edizione, Venezia, 1537).

Euclide sta sulla porta che dà accesso al recinto del sapere.  Alla sinistra di Euclide un personaggio tenta di entrare nel recinto per altra via, ma invano.  Nel recinto c'è un cannone e un mortaio che sparano, a indicare gli usi pratici della matematica.  Lo stesso Tartaglia è circondato da una serie di scienze. In prima fila figura il quadrivio - aritmetica, geometria, musica, astronomia -, quindi altre "scienze" più o meno lecite quali: prospettiva, "horospitio", "necromantia", "sortilegio".
Aristotele e Platone sorvegliano l'ingresso ad un secondo più elevato recinto, cui si accede solo dal primo.  Platone tiene in mano la scritta che vietava l'ingresso nell'Academia a chi non sapeva la geometria.  Nella parte più alta troneggia la filosofia. (p. 35, "Galileo Galilei e gli scienziati del ducato di Urbino")

In this work, Tartaglia discussed the mathematics of artillery and developed methods for determining the range of a cannon. The caption below the illustration reads, "The Mathematical sciences speak:  Who wishes to know the various causes of things, learn about us.  The way is open to all."  The illustration itself depicts a walled compound, the compound of knowlege.  The high wall keeps out the man who attempts to scale it and enter improperly.  Entrance into the compound is through a single door opened by Euclid.  In the first courtyard, a crowd comprised of Tartaglia and the muses of the seven liberal arts watch a demonstration of Tartaglia's new knowlege, a theory of trajectories.  Beyond the first courtyard is a second smaller, more exclusive and highly elevated one.  Its entrance is manned by Aristotle and Plato.  Plato holds a banner proclaiming, "No one can enter who does not know geometry."  Enthroned at the rear of this compound, in the highest position of all, is philosophy.

De' Zanchi lavoro' nel campo delle fortificazioni militari in Italia, Fiandra, Austria e Cipro al servizio di Venezia. Quanta matematica deve conoscere un tecnico?  Sul tema si sviluppa nel Cinquecento un dibattito molto vivace.  Le obiezioni piu' forti venivano da parte di coloro che sostenevano la prevalenza dell'esperienza sulle conoscenze teoriche.
Il De' Zanchi sostiene una posizione equilibrata: occorre "havere le gia' dette regole, non solo per ragione intese, ma anco per esperienza altrui, o sendo possibile, ancor propria, alle quali parti servono la prontezza, e vivacita' dello spirito, e l'uso lungo della milizia (...) Vi giovano poi, e in parte son necessarie la geometria, l'aritmetica per numerare, e dividere le misure delle fortezze, la prospettiva vi ha parte, per poter considare le distantie e altezze, la manuale architettura de' modelli".

John Amos Comenius (1592--1670) lived during the Thirty Years' War (1618--1648). This was one of the most savage and destructive wars in Europe.   He was an educator and a rare voice for tolerance, equality, and reason.  Like the ancient philosophers he advocated universal education. In his /Magna Didactica/ he wrote

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
\ldots sed omnes pariter, nobiles at ignobiles, divites et pauperes pueros et puellas per omnes urbes et oppida pagosque et villas scholis esse adhibendos sequentia evincunt. (9.1)
#+END_QUOTE

That is, all alike, noble and ignoble, rich and poor boys and girls \ldots should be sent to school \cite[p. 60]{Comenius:1657a}.

Comenius does not single out mathematics from the other school subjects. He mentions it in chapter 30, "Scholae Latinae delineatio" where delineates his curriculum with a list of 13 items. Item four is arithmetic and five is geometry. They are listed immediately after the language items.

Comenius realized that his education reform program would face many obstacles. It was after all a reform of profound political implications. In the last chapter of his book (33) he appeals to the rulers of Europe (dominatores populorum at magistratus politici) to erect schools (aedificaveritis synagogas) for the children (parvulos) (p. 238).  Comenius tries to convince them that the cost of funding schools is justified because education is more important than military training (militarem scientiam instrui) and infrastructure, because a "vir enmim bonus et sapiens pretiosissimum est totius rei-publicae cimelion," (p. 239). That is, a good and wise man is the most precious treasure of the state.  He continues to exhort the political class using Biblical quotations and concludes the book with a prayer.

Unfortunately, his appeal to noble ideals would not convince the rulers to fund schools where mathematics could be taught.  Mathematician teachers and professors found a more convincing argument that actually was the opposite of what Comenius wrote. That is, military training was more valuable than goodness and wisdom.

The introduction of gun powder in Europe changed warfare from a "sport between nobles" to a "chess game between generals."  Guns and artillery improved and became more and more important on the battle field.  The mathematicians of the Renaissance in Italy hoped that they could solicit state support by showing the ruling class how mathematics could help calculate trajectories, arrange armies, and build defenses. Nicoló Tartaglia published a book titled /La Nova Scientia/ in 1537 and dedicated it to the Duke of Urbino. It contains, among other subjects, methods to calculate the range of cannon balls.  Galileo Galilei published in 1606 a manual with military applications titled /Le operazioni del compasso geometrico et militare/ and dedicated it to the Prince of Tuscany. He was the first mathematician to discover how to calculate the maximum range of cannon balls.  The Renaissance military architect De' Zanchi wrote that military engineers needed to know geometry and arithmetic \cite[p. 36]{Gamba:1989kx}.

These efforts did not have much success, most probably because ballistics was more an art than a science.  The mathematical calculations did not take into account air drag and other factors that determined the trajectory of a cannon ball.  The calculations of Tartaglia and Galileo would work only for short trajectories where air drag would still be negligible \cite{Steele:1994aa}.

The people who would make ballistics a real science were the English Benjamin Robins (1707--1751) and the German Leonhard Euler (1707--1783).  Robins published in 1742 the /New Principles of Gunnery/. In 1745, at request of the King of Prussia Frederick the Great,[fn:22] Euler translated  into German Robins' work and added new material that Euler himself had developed.  At that time Euler was employed by the King of Prussia and Frederick wanted his artillery officers to have the best ballistics book available at that time \cite{Steele:1994aa}

Soon afterward the Seven Years' War started (1754--1763) where the new and improved ballistics would be applied.  England and Prussia were victorious and France and its allies lost.  The terms of peace were dire for France, which lost Canada, India and other oversee territories to the English.  The French government realized that one of the causes for the defeat was the technological inferiority of the artillery.  Prussian artillery pieces and their officers were superior to their French equivalents.

On 23 August 1774 the French minister of marine wrote to King Louis XVI

He proposed that the two books written by Euler be translated and used by the navy and artillery schools.

By this time the main governments in Europe had established military schools and the U.S.A. would not be far behind. These schools were funded by the state treasury and one of the most important subjects in the military schools was mathematics. The famous mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace taught at the \'Ecole Militaire in Paris. This institution was founded by King Louis XV in 1752. Its most famous graduate was Napol\'eon Bonaparte, who was good at mathematics, and completed the school in one year instead of two.  His examiner was the same Laplace.  Napoléon became an artillery officer and used the, by now, superior French artillery to become the great general.  We could say that it was the "power of mathematics."

\citeA{Steele:1994aa} explains how ballistics was revolutionized by the work of mathematicians Benjamin Robins (1707-1751) and Leonhard Euler (1707-1783).  Galileo Galilei's projectile theory ignored air resistance, while Isaac Newton and Christian Huygens oversimplified it.

Robins published his initial discoveries in "New Principles of Gunnery" in 1742.  Euler translated his work in German and added his mathematical analysis in 1745. Later he produced numerical tables that accurately predicted projectile trajectories.

"The ballistics revolution generated new theories that offered a rational understanding of gunnery, the technology of controlling gunfire. This made the teaching of calculus and mechanics to artillery and engineering officers increasingly profitable for Western governments during the second half of the 18th century. The increased precision and reduced uncertainty of their artillery fire in battlefields and sieges proved to be a return for this educational investment." \cite{Steele:1994aa}

Galileo Galilei published his studies on ballistics in "Two New Sciences" in 1638. As previously mentioned, he neglects air resistance.  Galileo himself was aware of this omission and correctly mentions that is it is valid for heavy mortar shells fired at low speeds.  He produced a table that showed the distance attained by the balls as function of the elevations of the mortars.

Nicholas François Blondel incorporated Galileo's theory in his "L'art de jeter les bombes" (Amsterdam, 1669). Likewise did Surirey de Saint Rémy in "Mémoires d'artillerie" (Amsterdam, 1702).

\citeA{Steele:1994aa} wrote that "Western Europeans had recognized the value of uniting mathematical theory wih technological practice in the education of military engineers and artillery commanders since the 16th century."

\citeA{Steele:1994aa} wrote that "Benjamin Robins received the Royal Society's Copley Medal in 1747 for his work in ballistics"

invitation by the prince of Orange to assist the Dutch defence of Bergen op Zoom in 1747.

Applied for a position as professor of mathematics at the recently established Royal Military Academy in Woolwich in 1741 \cite{Steele:1994aa}.  Later appointed engineer general of the East India Company and captain of the Madras Artillery in 1749.

In 1747, during the War of the Austrian Succession, the French army laid siege to it again. At that time, Bergen op Zoom had fortifications built in the beginning of the 17th Century by Menno van Coehoorn (military engineer, employed by the Dutch state), with three forts surrounding the city and a canalized diversion of the Scheldt acting as a ditch around its walls. However, it had no second line of fortifications, nor any fortress. After seventy days of siege, the city was taken and thoroughly sacked; the garrison was slaughtered. Due to this battle, the name of the city can be seen on one of the arches on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.

Adam Smith wrote that "in ancient times the opulent and civilized found it difficult to defend themselves against the poor and barbarous.  In modern times, the poor and the barbarous find it difficult to defend themselves against the opulent and civilized."

This change occurred because of "the invention of firearms, an invention which at first sight appears to be so pernicious, is certainly favorable both to the permanency and to the extension of civilization"   (Quincy Wright, "A study of war", Chicago: Chicago University Press, 1965, p. 313, noted by Howard \citeNP{Rosen:1981aa}, "The système Gribeauval").

\citeA[p. 4]{Rosen:1981aa} noted that "money could only purchase power, it could not produce it." and (1981, p. 4) that "the technical sources of production had themselves become preponderant basis for military force."

Rosen explains the emergence in the 18th century Europe of an "arms race" as expressed in the technology of firepower, especially artillery.  The author stated that an arms race is "a situation in which competing states have committed their security to the products of high technology.   I think that today the competition between states (1) has lost it pre-eminence and has been surpassed as competition between systems of thought.  These systems of thought strive with each other through the media, by providing (mis)information and withholding it and by differences in behaviour such as thriftiness, career choices, financial choices, and reproductive choices and relocation.   At a day by day level these changes in equilibria are not evident, but as Michel Foucault has stated that most people do not know "what what they do does."

Rosen notes that technological progress is not sufficient.  It has to be joined with and is actually dependent on "the creation of appropriate and often largely new institutional structures for its effective implementation" (p. 6).

"Apparently Euler rather than Frederick and his courtiers in 1742 proposed translating into German Robins' "Principles of Gunnery," for long a subject in applied mathematics that had a strong support in court (Bradley & Sandifer, "Leonhard Euler: life, work and legacy", p. 25).

"Publishing this work in German indicates that it was intended to improve the competency of lower military officers.  Euler's later tables for mortar fire, included in a French translation, were studied by Napoléon Bonaparte and used to World War II." (p. 26).

Napoléon Bonaparte was admitted in May 1779 to the military academy at Brienned-le-Château.  An examiner observed that he "has always been distinguished for his application in mathematics..."  He completed his studies in 1784 and was admitted to the elite École Militaire in Paris where he trained to become an artillery officer.  His ability as artillery officer saved the French Revolution from the royalists in 1795 (McLynn, 1998, p. 96, Napoleon. Pimlico, ISBN 0712662472.

Gribeauval, "Early indications of mathematical ability encouraged him to pursue a career in the tachnical branch of the military service (Rosen, p. 18).  Reforms by Jean-Florent de Vallière promotion was based on merit and formal education became a requirement for all officers (p. 19).

Reaction to the disaster of the Seven Year War.  "The war was a shock to French pride and it exposed a number of deficiencies in the Old Regime. Captain DuBois in his "Mémoire" (1764) noted a tremendous increase in German artillery and observed that France must do the same (Rosen, p. 25).

The guns of the système Gribeauval were supplied with a device known as the hausse, an adjustable screw with a calibrated guide. It was introduced at this time because of the general increase in mathematical knowledge among French artillerists (Ildefonse Favé, Histoire et tactique des trois armes et plus particulièrement de l'artillerie de campagne, Paris: Bachelier, 1845, p. 150) (Rosen p. 35).  Maritz boring machine. Boring machine was essential in the production of James Watt's steam engine.

Rosen (p. 47) "... the chefs de Brigade were given responsibility for the practical instruction of the officers in each brigade.  They were expected to "teach the application of theory to practice" utilizing their knowledge of the details of artillery and their overall artillery experience which "went beyond the competence of a professor of mathematics." (Ordonnance 13 August 1765," Archives the guerre, carton y^a 42.)

Foreign developments provided an awareness of external threat and competition (Rosen, p. 52).

Ordonnance of 5 February 1720 established artillery schools which would provided training (Rosen, p. 57).  Unlike infantry, artillerists were required to pass an examination before receiving commission. This could take several years of study and preparation (Rosen, p. 60).

Ordonnance 5 July 1729 "NO subordinate, no matter what seniority he may possess, may advance without a demonstration of the intelligence and capacity to perform the functions required at artillery." Rosen, p. 62.

The creation of schools of artillery with highly competent staff and a rigorous curriculum.  Ordonnace of 5 February 1720 created 5 schools in La Fère, Metz, Strasbourg, Grenoble, and Perpignan by Vallière with Camus Destouches.  Very rigorous, e.g. members of the Académie royale des sciences: Charles Etienne Louis Camus, Etienne Bézout, and Simon de Laplace were all examinateurs-pour l'artillerie. (Rosen, 78).  Three days a week, the officers would study mathematics, mechanics, and cartography.

The beginning of all modern technical education has been traced to the French artillery schools of the eighteenth century. (Rosen, p. 80). 

Every six months, each officer was given the opportunity to demonstrate his ability in mathematics. Officers were given examinations and the results were put into the record and forwarded to the Minister.  Not even the professors of mathematics escaped evaluation (p. 80).  Mathematical knowledge was the "fundamental basis for the entire science of being an officer in the artillery." (Rosen, p. 81).

The French Academy of Sciences published a translation in 1751.

Bernard Forest de Bélidor (1698-1761), professor at the Ècole de La Fère. Il publie en 1725 son Nouveau cours de mathématique à l'usage de l'Artillerie et du Génie, où apparaît pour la première fois le mot « sinusoïde ». Ce cours est traduit en allemand en 1745. Il sera bientôt employé dans toutes les écoles d'artillerie

Suite à la création du corps des ponts et chaussées en 1716, un arrêt du conseil du Roi décide en 1747 de la mise en place d'une formation spécifique des ingénieurs d'État, l'école royale des ponts et chaussées, fondement de la future École nationale des ponts et chaussées, mise en place par Daniel-Charles Trudaine. Il s'agit alors du début du contrôle progressif et efficace par l'État de la construction des routes, ponts et canaux et de la formation des ingénieurs du génie civil.

Il publie en 1731 un traité de balistique, Le Bombardier français, suivi en 1737 de son ouvrage majeur, L'Architecture hydraulique, où le calcul intégral est utilisé pour la première fois dans la résolution de problèmes techniques. Ce sera là tout le bagage et fourniment des ingénieurs jusqu'à la fin du siècle et l'ouvrage de référence des élèves de l'École des ponts et chaussées.

The new scientific ground opened by Robins's and Euler's revolution in ballistics was rapidly utilized by the European military establishments.  Euler's initial motivation to translate New Principles of Gunnery was provided by Frederick the Great, who wanted Euler to translate into German the best artillery theory book available in order to increase his artillery officers' competence in gunnery.85

The French soon took notice of these Prussian and English ballistics developments.86 New Principles of Gunnery was originally translated into French in 1751 by Jean-Baptiste Le Roy. According to Truesdell, Anne Robert Jacques Turgot wrote to Louis XVI in 1774 that "the famous Leonard Euler, one of the greatest mathematicians of Europe, has written two works which could be very useful to the schools of the navy and the artillery. One is a Treatise on the construction and Maneuver of Vessels; the other is a commentary on the principles of artillery of Robins.... I propose that Your Majesty order these to be printed."8

The ballistics revolution offers one explanation of why the Ecole Polytechnique provided such advanced scientific and mathematical education-to prepare cadets with sufficient knowledge to comprehend advanced ballistics textbooks such The Ballistics Revolution 371 as the fourth volume of Etienne Bezout's Cours de mathimatiques, a l'usage du corps de l'artillerie (first published in 1772) or Lombard's Traite du mouvement des projectiles, applique au tir des bouches d feu.88

During the Napoleonic Wars, more Ecole Polytechnique graduates served in the artillery than in any other branch of the French military.9 One of the consequences of providing such an education was the mathematization of physics during the early 19th century, as the work of AugustinJean Fresnel, Etienne Louis Malus, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, Sadi Carnot, and other École Polytechnique graduates so dramatically demonstrated.

Great Britain was also inspired in part by the ballistics revolution to increase the scientific and mathematical education of artillery officers.  The British established a military academy for the education of artillery and engineering officers in 1741. Its specific purpose, according to its warrant, was to instruct "the raw and inexperienced People belonging to the Military Branch of this (Ordnance) Office, in the several parts of Mathematicks necessary to qualify them for the Service of the Artillery, and the business of Engineers."96 From the very beginning, the combina- tion of theory and practice was to be the means of instruction. The original rules for the new academy stated "that an Academy or School shall forthwith be established and opened at the Warren at Woolwich in Kent, for instructing the people of the Military branch of the Ordnance, wherein shall be taught, both in theory and practice, whatever may be necessary or useful to form good Officers of Artillery and perfect Engineers."97 The quality of the scientific and mathematical education at Woolwich never reached the level of the French military schools. Nevertheless, the mathematics taught by Hutton, as demonstrated by his textbook A Course of Mathematics, in Two Volumes: Composed and more Especially Designed, for the use of the Gentlemen Cadets in the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, shows the cadets had the opportunity to learn enough mathematics to comprehend Robins's and Euler's ballistics work.98 Hutton seems to have used New Principles of Gunnery as a textbook when teaching ballistics during his thirty-four-year tenure at Woolwich beginning in 1773, and he edited a new edition in 1805.99

Henry Knox, the commander of the Continental army's artillery during the American War of Independence, was sufficiently impressed with Woolwich's graduates to send an urgent letter to the Continental Congress after the American defeat at Long Island in 1776: "As officers can never act with confidence until they are masters of their profession, an academy established upon a liberal plan would be of the utmost service to the continent, where the whole theory and practice of fortification and gunnery should be taught, to be nearly on the same plan as that at Woolwich-making allowances for differences of circumstances-a place to which our enemies are indebted for the superiority of their artillery to all who have opposed them."'0 0 Knox tried to maintain the quality of his artillery officers during the Revolution by requesting that "no officer should be appointed to the artillery who does not possess a proper knowledge of the mathematics and other necessary abilities for the nature of the service."''?
 
Hamilton therefore wrote with considerable authority in 1799 that an American military academy for military engineering and artillery officers should include such topics as calculus, conic sections, chemistry, hydraulics, hydrostatics, pneumatics, and the theory and practice of gunnery and fortification design.1

Tempelhoff commanded the Prussian artillery during the French Revolutionary War and was the director of the Prussian Militarakademie der Artillerie from 1791 to 1807. Not only did he write a number of mathematics textbooks for the Prussian artillery corps, with subjects ranging from geometry to differ- ential and integral calculus, but he also wrote Le bombardier prussien, a theoretical ballistics work that built on Robins's and Euler's analysis.106 Frederick the Great praised the work, but he offered his sincerest compliment by restricting its distribution for national security reasons.10

The use of such tables in 18th-century warfare raises another ques- tion: if ballistics and range tables were available, why then did European governments take the trouble to provide artillery officers with a mathematical and scientific education? Is it really necessary to know ballistics theory in order to use numerical tables? Napoleon Bonaparte seemed to think so. He wrote in 1801 that some of Lombard's and Robins's ballistics theories are important for the artillery and should therefore be included in the textbooks for the proposed artillery and engineering school at Metz."l7 Eighteenth-century gunnery tables were designed to speed up calcu- lations, not to replace a solid grasp of the theory. Euler/Graevenitz's table, for example (fig. 4), is quite incomprehensible to someone who does not understand its derivation. Furthermore, there was much more to 18th-century gunnery than simply establishing the correct angle to launch a projectile to a desired distance.

These tables are based on certain simplifying assumptions, however, and could give misleading results if used under conditions that might violate these assumptions. Hence, only officers with a solid grasp of the theory could use these tables with full confidence, a quality not to be taken for granted during the tremendous confusion and uncertainty of combat. As Matti Lauerma wrote in /L'artillerie de campagne française pendant les guerres de la revolution/, "The lack of fundamental theoretical knowledge apparently diminished the accuracy of artillery fire to a considerable extent."

As a result, the military powers of 18th-century Europe had to improve their artillery officers' education in mathematics and science to compete effectively in warfare. 

"An algebraist, who lives locked up in his cabinet, sees nothing but numbers, and propositions, which produce no effect in the moral world. The progress of manners is of more worth to society than all the calculations of Newton" (Letter from Frederick II to D'Alembert, 4 January 1770, from Cajori, 1927).

The king's inquiry for the best book on artillery led Euler's translation into German in 1745, of the treatise by Benjamin Robins.  Euler's important commentaries thereon were translated into French and English (Cajori, 1927).

"Euler en vain calculs met sa philosophie"  He would not nominate his president of the Royal Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin, even when no other suitable candidate existed.

Without appreciation of the great rôle which mathematics was playing in the intellectual life of Europe, the king tolerated the mathematicians at his court simply as ornaments.

National pride: invitation to Lagrange at Turin "The greatest king of Europe" wishes to have "the greatest mathematician" at his court.

+ From \cite{Burrill:2001aa} with my comments:
"The jobs of the next century will involve discrete mathematics, operations research, statistics and data analysis, information processing, and coding." (p. 26)

Personally, I am very, very sceptical of this.  Most technology will use easy to use interfaces.   You do not need to know how a computer works to be a data entry clerk.  I think that this is all self-serving propaganda.  Similarly the technology/informatics companies cry wolf for the purpose of importing H1 people from India to keep the salaries low and the jobs un-unionized.  The real need of a nation, even supposedly the most technologically advanced one, for scientists and mathematicians are minuscule.  We have more need for engineers and business people, but even that can easily be filled by less than our existing educational structures.

Notice all those people 'crying wolf' from 1902 on. (p. 27)

Now let us compare this recent history with recommendations made in 1923 by a committee that studied secondary school mathematics.  The NC MR stated that the "United States is far behind Europe in the scientific and professional training required of its secondary teachers" (1923, 16). NCMR = National Committee on Mathematics Requirements

In his first press conference on the TIMSS results (Schmidt 1966), he said that a gap in course taking by U.S. teachers did not exist.  U.S. teachers have had as many college mathematics courses as teachers in other countries, but their poor preparation in school mathematics makes this irrelevant. (p. 174)

Riley's speech was not exceptional for its content. He talked about the importance of mathematics and urged the combatants in the mathematics wars to conduct themselves with civility and respect.  What made the talk exceptional was who delivered it.  .... Riley's speech signaled that mathematics is different.  The last time that the federal government became heavily involved with a curriculum dispute was in the 1960s, and, then as now, the subject was mathematics. (p. 185)

+ That is why the power-knowledge relationship is so important for Foucault.  It is not that knowledge can be accounted for by recourse to explanation in terms of power, for knowledge is not merely an effect of power. But knowledge and power are not unrelated: an account of either without reference to the other is simply incomplete.  Rather, as Deleuze (1988) has shown, the problem Foucault understood, and which his writings are an attempt to solve, is how it is that knowledge and power can be heterogeneous and yet mutually reinforcing, with knowledge producing effects of power and power producing effects of knowledge. This problem - or at least its status as an important problem - is of recent origin.  Without the proliferation of modes of access to knowledge (the general rise in literacy and public education), without the proliferation of domains of application of knowledge (public health, schools, jobs employing skilled workers), without technologies of communication, information, and education, the problem of the relationships between power and knowledge would have remained a peripheral one.  An arcane power only marginally applied does not constitute a vital political problem.  It is in Western society, with its peculiar level of development (in part caused bye the intertwining of knowledge and power), that analyses of the relationships between knowledge and power become more pressing, and even urgent. (Todd May, Between genealogy and epistemology, Pennsylvania State University Press, University Park, Pennsylvania, 1993, p. 51-52).


+ Phronesis
Bent Flyvbjerg, in his book Making Social Science Matter, has argued that instead of trying to emulate the natural sciences, the social sciences should be practiced as phronesis. Phronetic social science [1] focuses on four value-rational questions: (1) Where are we going? (2) Who gains and who loses, by which mechanisms of power? (3) Is this development desirable? (4) What should we do about it?

In "After Virtue" Alasdair MacIntyre makes a similar call for a phronetic social science, combined with weighty criticism of attempts by social scientists to emulate natural science. He points out that for every prediction made by a social scientific theory there are usually counter-examples. These derive from the unpredictability of human beings, and the fact that one unpredictable human being can have a world-changing impact. Following Pascal, he argues that the shape of Cleopatra's nose changed the course of history, for if her profile had not been beautiful it is unlikely (according to this argument) that Mark Anthony would have pursued her, with significant consequences for Roman political history.

+ War movie "Memphis Belle"

+ Following up on the brutally honest War Against Hope, former Education Secretary Rod Paige (with his sister Dr. Elaine Witty) turns his focus specifically to The Black-White Achievement Gap in our country's schools in his latest book. Beginning with the fact that many African American's exiting 12th grade are achieving at the same academic level as a white student exiting the 8th grade, Paige and Witty examine failures in leadership, the positive impact of NCLB and offer solutions to fixing "the greatest civil rights issue of our time."

+ ANOTHER DoED INVESTMENT SCHEME. A lesser-discussed federal competition for education grants, the Investing in Innovation Fund, has formally begun. The goal is to have nonprofits partner with school districts to develop innovative programs within the framework of the President's reform agenda. Unlike R2TT, though, i3 requires "evidence of success" - not just promises - before grants are awarded. Imagine the uproar if a nonprofit joined with the District of Columbia to continue the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program through a grant aimed at addressing the Administration's "turning around persistently low-performing schools" priority? Parents could choose to move their kids out of a failing school and into a stable and positive situation, forcing DCPS to make real changes in order to remain competitive.  Innovative? Effective? Proven successful? All of the above. "Many of our generation's greatest breakthroughs occur when people are willing to invest in small scale projects with big scale potential," said Secretary Duncan in a release. Sounds like DCOSP.

*** STRT Present situation in the USA

We will begin with a brief description of the present public school funding in the USA. For the school year 2006-2007 (the latest data available), at the national level, the total expenditure was $555,337,583, of which $244,069,269 came from local sources, $264,226,896 from state funding and $47,041,419 from the federal government. This corresponds to 43.9% local, 47.6% state, and 8.5% federal.  For the State of Texas these figures were $43,282,278, $22,466,902, $16,349,077, $4,466,298, 51.9%, 37.8%, and 10.3%[fn:65].

The distribution among funding sources is another peculiarity of the US schooling system.  In most countries funding for public schools is managed at a national level and thus there is little disparity between the quality of the individual schools in these countries.  Teacher salaries tend to be equal throughout the country and there is little disparity between funding of schools.  Thus the differences are due to the ability (and honesty) of the local administrators and the local culture and quality of life.  In the USA because local funding makes up about half to the total amount the tax base has large impact and thus wealthy areas have better schools and teachers than poor ones.  Of the many books written on this subject one of the most well know are those written by Jonathan \citeA{Kozol:1991aa,Kozol:2006aa}.

David \citeA{Boaz:2006aa} wrote that "the U.S. Constitution grants no authority over education to the federal government. Education is not mentioned in the Constitution of the United States,".  The U.S. Supreme Court stated in 1973 that education though important "is not among the rights afforded explicit protection under our Federal Constitution. Nor do we find any basis for saying it is implicitly so protected." \cite{Boaz:2006aa}.

That is why these existence of a national policy for education in the USA is a more recent phenomenon that has parallelled the growth of the federal government. The U.S. Department of Education was established in 1980 by President Jimmy Carter.  In contrast, the Texas Education Agency was created in 1949. Its function is "to provide leadership, guidance and resources to help schools meet the educational needs of all students." \cite{TEA:2010aa}.   

As we have seen there is no mention of education in the U.S. constitution.  However, it is part of the first constitution of the State of Texas, which was adopted in 1845[fn:68] and all later versions. According to Article X[fn:69]

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

I would to present an article published in the June 2009 McKinsey Quarterly by Auguste, Hancock and Laboissière.  The authors are employees of McKinsey and Company.

A persistent gap in academic achievement between children in the United States and their counterparts in other countries deprived the US economy of as much as $2.3 trillion in economic output in 2008, McKinsey research finds.1 Moreover, each of the long-standing achievement gaps among US students of differing ethnic origins, income levels, and school systems represents hundreds of billions of dollars in unrealized economic gains. Together, these disturbing gaps underscore the staggering economic and social cost of underutilized human potential. Yet they also create room for hope by suggesting that the widespread application of best practices could secure a better, more equitable education for the country’s children-along with substantial economic gains.

This five-page article refers to a 24 page report by the same company titled "The Economic Impact of the Achievement gap in America's Schools"

* STRT Findings, Discussion & Conclusions				:chp:
#<<findings>>

At the beginning of my research, based on my literature review and other readings as well as conversation with professors and colleagues, I had formulated the following working hypothesis:

There is a hegemonic tendency in US politics and culture whereby the US has to have pre-eminence among the nations of the earth.  This is connected to the idea of 'manifest destiny' and the fact that the US is a creation of the 'democratic will of the people'. At the end of the 19th century the U.S.A. was firmly placed among what Immanuel Wallerstein called the Core nations in his World-Systems Analysis (ref.).

This pre-eminence in a capitalistic society has to be understood in economic terms whereby the military might is at the service of the capitalistic free-enterprise economy. Such a type of economy has to be highly technical and sophisticated.  Thus is requires a highly educated workforce.  This type of workforce requires advanced mathematical skills.

A skilled workforce is an expensive workforce.  Thus, have companies tried to lower this cost by easing the immigration of skilled workers (e.g. H-1B visas) and by fostering STEM education.  This is interwoven with the publication of documents that place in doubt the pre-eminence of the U.S.A. such as "A nation at risk" (see fig. ANAR.png). 

#/home/henk/Dropbox/dissertation/Data/GoogleNgram-ANAR.png

Hence the public awareness of the international achievement gap.  In the public mind such as situation is a national danger that has to be addressed.  From an utilitarian point of view, there IAG does not affect the economic standing of the U.S.A..  The country produces more than enough scientists, mathematicians, and engineers.  Indeed the employment situation of scientists in unsatisfactory.  PhD graduates in science find an weak job market with depressed salaries.  The massive de-industrialization of the U.S.A. has likewise greatly reduced the job market for engineers and the tech bubble has had the same effect on the employment prospects of computer science majors.

So, why does this kind of discourse still appear so important?  At the 2011 State of the Union Address, the president spoke about 'this generation's Sputnik moment'.[fn:106]

This probably happened because the invaders were mainly males who married local women.  The mothers would teach their own language to their children.  By the time that the Normans invaded England they spoke French and not Danish.  All Philistine inscriptions found are in Canaaitic, not Greek. Sometimes the conquerors do not want the conquered to speak the language of the winners to keep them at a disadvantage.   See again the Normans in England.  Sometimes the élite would speak a foreign language for the same reason.  For instance, the Russian nobility would speak French so that their Russian subject would not understand them.

[fn:88] Previously the term "English as a second language" was used.  I suppose it is not acceptable to consider English anything but the first language. Thus, it is the first language or just "not yet" the first language with the understanding that the person is doing its very best to become proficient and not to use any other language in preference to English.

[fn:89] Socrates: 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The error was just as if some one who wanted to divide the human race, were to divide them after the fashion which prevails in this part of the world; here they cut off the Hellenes as one species, and all the other species of mankind, which are innumerable, and have no ties or common language, they include under the single name of "barbarians," and because they have one name they are supposed to be of one species also. Or suppose that in dividing numbers you were to cut off ten thousand from all the rest, and make of it one species, comprehending the first under another separate name, you might say that here too was a single class, because you had given it a single name. Whereas you would make a much better and more equal and logical classification of numbers, if you divided them into odd and even; or of the human species, if you divided them into male and female; and only separated off Lydians or Phrygians, or any other tribe, and arrayed them against the rest of the world, when you could no longer make a division into parts which were also classes.

[fn:90] I am not arguing here whether the USA is a classless society or not. I do think that it is in all societies be they technologically advanced or primitive, capitalist or communist, but that is not my point here.  I take the myth at face value. A significant proportion of the population in the USA thinks that it is, or in any case it is part and parcel of the dominant political and cultural discourse in the country.  Any perfunctory examination of election campaign material will quickly detect this.  One of the sobering aspects of the Katrina has been that it has shown the myth of the classless society for what it is, a vague collective desire at best and a cruel farce at worst.

[fn:92] It is ironic to notice that it is politically correct to mock an Afro-American or Hispanic for the way that he or she speaks, but it is not acceptable to do so on the way that the person's physical appearance.

This is an emendation of a previous act, thus it is almost impossible to read as a discourse.  Only the initial part has "prose" and is thus analyzed.

** Appendix G - R commands				      :noexport:temp:
#<<appendix-g>>
The following /R/ commands were used to perform statistical analysis and text mining on the data. The symbol ">" indicates the /R/ environment command prompt.  First we load the required text mining packages "tm" and "RWeka".  Then we create a 'corpus' of the congressional hearings by importing them as text files.

After importing we do some basic text manipulation, (1) removal of white spaces, (2) change into lower case, and (3) removal of stop-words.

To run the /R/ scripts type the following at the R prompt

> source('/home/henk/Dropbox/dissertation/bill.R', verbose=TRUE)
