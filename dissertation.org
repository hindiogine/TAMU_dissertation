Action items
- [X] write action items and send to committee members
- [X] convert to word - tth tamuthesis.tex -> Writer -> load html -> save as odt
- [ ] work with Thesis Office to correct formatting problems, especially APA format
- [ ] Chp. 4, identify tables, charts essential to your arguments
- [X] reduce # appendices
- [ ] involve whole committee on all communications
- [ ] write summary for each chapter or section
- [ ] reduce/eliminate redundancies

LB (1): lots of "stuff", make sense out of relationships between graphs, tables and text -> appendix.
Write longer narratives, reorganization

LB (2): why are all these levels of detail required?  Are all the steps necessary?  Present only what is necessary.

LB (3): citation methods, follow APA format

KMK: (1) tie up -> chp 6, pull together.  This is how the discourse is constructed, this is what it is doing.
(2) APA issues, redundancies.  Place summary at end of each chapter (section?).  Most important: data rich, but analysis poor -> close circle
post-structural -> coherent
Think about problematize/deconstruct AGs, see as problem, national security.
Government rationalizes what is done. Diagnosis, what is happening expose blind spots.  How discourse of national security with AGs.  Categories constructed by us.

GK: dis-aggregation by race (check in text of NCLB, also in Clinton's precursor??).  Variables: accountability, testing.

Very clearly state at the end -> summary.  This is what the discourse was, tell at the end

Dis-aggregation in the 80's -> ball rolling, problem in ranking of students.  Chapter 6 -> summaries.

Explanatory paragraphs for tables and figures.  Close the loop in chp. 6 -> pull together

GK: decrease # tables and figures.  Identify a handful of variables (5+-2).

KMK: scale back, think circle, coming back.  pieces -> deconstruction -> this is what it means

GK: lop off?  reduce appendices -> Thesis Office

* Dr. Kulm						      :noexport:temp:

I have read the dissertation. Overall,  it reads well and has a flow and logic.  Just a few comments - a couple that are minor and a couple that we need to discuss further.

** Smaller issues [7/7]

- [X] On page 2 there is a repeated paragraph
- [X] On page 8, you refer to Figure 1.1 on page 8. Don't need the mention of the page.
- [X] You should check with the Thesis office about getting permission to use the Creswell figure on page 47 - some previous students of mine have been required to do that when you use a figure directly from another source.
- [X] On page 49 (and a few other places), you have (ref?) but need to provide a relevant reference.
- [X] Throughout, for consistency, I suggest using only authors’ last names. In cases such as referring to the Secretary of Education, President, etc. first and last is OK.
- [X] Tables 3.6 and 3.7 have the same title. Need to make them a little more descriptive and different.
- [X] Throughout, you often refer to Figures and Table both by their number and page. I suggest not using the page. The page number might change as you edit, making it hard to re-edit to keep page numbers accurate.
 
** Larger issues [3/4]

- [X] On pages 50-60, there is a great deal of detail - even to the extent of describing buttons you clicked on for some analyses procedures. I got bogged down, and am concerned that others would too. I wonder if there is some way to summarize this. I would not want you to take many days away from your task of finishing Chapter 6 to do this, but what do you think? The details might go in an Appendix. I know I have already asked you to put a great amount of detailed information in the Appendix, but ....

- [X] On pages 89-104, Tables 4.2 - 4.6 list a lot of detailed information that might go in the Appendix. You summarized some of that in a couple of tables, which I think are sufficient.

- [X] On pages 107-138, the figures go on and on. You do repeat many of them, albeit over-layed, in Chapter 5, so how important is it to report them singly here? Again, I wonder which ones are essential to the main text, and if many of them might be in an Appendix.
 
- [ ] There is a huge amount of information in Chapter 4. You have made great strides in my earlier suggestion to tie together the research questions, analyses, and findings. I certainly don’t want to detract or diminish the extent and depth of analyses you have done. On the other hand, I want the committee to respond positively and not be overwhelmed. The primary goal at hand is to get your dissertation approved. The voluminous work, analysis, and findings you have produced can be a source of papers, manuscripts, and even books in the future.

* TAMU Abstract								:chp:
#<<abstract>>

This work analyses the political discourse on the achievement gaps (AGs) at the federal level in light of Michel Foucault's governmentality.  The AGs have been for some years now an actively researched phenomenon in education in the U.S. as well as in the rest of the world.

The findings ....

# In the United States the teaching of mathematics in public schools enjoys ample attention and funding at the federal level. I intend to analyze how the concept of public support of mathematics teaching has evolved from its non-existent or rudimentary state in the past to today's largess. I will give special attention to how the public discourse on the public funding relates to the National Achievement Gap between White, African-American and Hispanic students (\cite{Downey:2009a}) and International Achievement Gap between the U.S.A. and other developed countries \cite{Chen:2010a}. The theoretical framework is largely provided Foucault's /genealogy/ and /governmentality/ 

# integrated with concepts of /social reproduction/ of Pierre Bourdieu, /hegemony/ by \citeA{Laclau:2001a}, and /political myth/ by Chiara \citeA{Bottici:2007a}. My research /methodology/ is largely inspired by Bruno \citeA{Latour:2005a}.

** STRT Statement of the Study 						:sec:
#<<intro-question>>
The research question itself can be briefly stated as "what insights and understandings on the federal education policy discourse does Foucault's governmentality offer on the achievement gaps, especially in mathematics?"

The concept of the academic achievement gaps is introduced in [[intro-background][Section 1.2]] and developed in [[lit-review-gap][Section 2.1]]. Discourse analysis in presented conceptually in [[lit-review-da][Section 2.2]] and operationally in [[method-qual-analysis][Section 3.2]]. Michel Foucault's governmentality is presented conceptually in [[lit-review-governmentality][Section 2.4]] and operationally in [[method-detailed-steps-I][Subsection 2.5.9]].

** COMP Background of the Study 					:sec:
#<<intro-background>>
In our contemporary society where universal education has become a reality, the focus of attention has shifted from its availability to its quality. There is a widespread perception in the United States that K-12 public education is not at the level it should be. Such a state is thought to have various negative effects ranging from the narrowing of career opportunities for the students all the way up to the loss of competitiveness of the nation in an increasingly unforgiving global economy.  Many attempts have been made to quantify the quality of education offered in our public schools.  From among the several available metrics, such as graduation rate, funding per student, time in school, educational level of the teachers, it comes as no surprise that the preferred metrics are some sort of test scores, preferably from standardized tests.

These test scores have been aggregated by nation by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (http://www.iea.nl) and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (http://www.pisa.oecd.org).  In addition the scores have been computed at the national level and disaggregated by ethnic and racial group by the National Center for Education Statistics (http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard) an agency of the U.S. Department of Education (US-ED).  In international rankings, the U.S.A. places near the bottom developed countries. Furthermore, at the national level there are persistent and significant differences between ethnic/racial groups where students of Asian and European descent have significantly higher scores than Native American students and students of African or Hispanic descent.  The first phenomenon is called the "international achievement gap" (IAG) and the second one the "racial, ethnic or national achievement gap" (NAG).  Both phenomena have been subject of extensive discussions and research, especially since the publication of the report called "A Nation at Risk" in 1983.

We will see that there two aspects to the AGs in mathematics and science education.  First of all, as we have just seen, there are two principal types of AGs, the disparity of the mathematics or science scores in the /Programme for International Student Assessment/ (PISA)[fn:1] and of the /Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study/ (TIMMS)[fn:2]. The second aspect is stubborn persistence and pervasiveness over all grades and regions of the U.S.A., of these national and international achievement gaps \cite[see e.g.]{Braun:2006a}.

We should speak about /Achievement Gap/ in the plural rather than in the singular. We can group achievement gaps into two broad categories, the /International Achievement Gap/ (IAG) and the /National Achievement Gap/ (NAG). In the literature the IAG can be referred to as the "global achievement gap" \cite{Wagner:2008a}, "transnational achievement gap" \cite{Rindermann:2009a}, or "international achievement differences" \cite{Stedman:1997a}.  In contrast, the NAG is can be denoted as "race gap" \cite{Bali:2003a}, "Black-White achievement gap" \cite{Bali:2004a,Braun:2006a,Levitt:2004a}, "African-American/white achievement gap" \cite{Haycock:2001a}, "minority achievement gap" \cite{Holloway:2004a}, "racial achievement gap" \cite{Lashaw:2010a,Wenglinsky:2004a}, "teaching gap" \cite{Stigler:2009a,Berry:2009a}, and "minority-majority achievement gap" \cite{White:2009a}.  Usually, when we just refer to "achievement gap", "student achievement gap" or "academic achievement gap", the NAG is intended \cite{Balfanz:2006a,Campbell:2005a,Cooper:2006a,DiGisi:2005a,Williams:2003a,Chubb:2002a,Miranda:2007a,Peevely:1999a,Berry:2009a}.  This can be noted from the following quote by \citeA[p. 333]{Maloney:2010a}

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The phrase "achievement gap" in education and political circles signifies the long-term and steady score gap between white, black, and Hispanic/Latino youth on standardized tests. Using the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) and SAT scores, researchers have shown that this gap, first recognized in the 1960s, fell by 20% to 40% (depending on the estimate) in the 1970s and 1980s, but then began widening in the late 1990s (Lee 2002; English 2002; Haycock 2001).
#+END_QUOTE

#+begin_latex
\noindent
#+end_latex
However, others such as \citeA[p. 1]{Downey:2009a} have a more nuanced view

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The first important step to take in confronting the achievement gap problem is to abandon the idea that one single thing, or even a few things in combination, will crack this apparently baffling educational conundrum.  And the first factor to confront is that there is no single "achievement gap" but many kinds of gaps. Using a national educational longitudinal data set, Carpenter Ramirez, and Severn (2006) found "not one but multiple achievement gaps, within and between groups" (p. 120) and "gaps between races may not be the most serious of them" (p. 123).
#+END_QUOTE

The international achievement gap is defined and understood in slightly different ways by various authors.  The general concept is that there exists a disparity (gap) between the proficiency of the students in U.S.A. and other countries that are considered its "peers."[fn:70]

A recent author on the subject, Tony \citeA[p. xxi]{Wagner:2008a}, defines this /Gap/ as the disparity between the "new skills" needed in "today's highly competitive global knowledge economy" and what the students are taught in class.

A more prosaic understanding of the gap is simply about the ranking of the U.S.A. in international studies.  This is however a very crude way of understanding the issue.  Ranking is often misleading because the differences in score points are not statistically significant.  For example, the document that in a certain sense started it all, the /A Nation at Risk/ \cite{NCEE:1983a}, was later re-analyzed and much less threatening results were found in the data. According to \citeA{Carson:1993a} the Simpson's paradox made several trends appear to go the opposite of their actual direction. This type of paradox occurs when the statistical data of distinct groups are pooled. That is, each group may exhibit a positive trend, but when combined the overall trend becomes negative. Most statisticians are aware of this paradox, but the layperson can easily be fooled by it.[fn:18]  However, according to Lawrence \citeA{Stedman:1994a} there were still reasons for concern even though the situation was not as dire as generally portrayed.  The standardized tests themselves have been subjected to extensive criticisms.  A simple re-norming would make any idea of trends meaningless.

The NAG is not a phenomenon that is restricted to the U.S. Public School System.  It exists also in private schools.  However, it seems that the NAG is narrower in private schools \cite{Coulson:2005a,Neal:1997a}.  Not much is known about the NAG in private schools.  Similarly, little is known about the NAG in home schooling. There again it seems that the gap is narrower if not eliminated \cite[pp. 4--5]{HSLDA:2001a}. However, we should notice that I was able to find only one citation and that it was not peer reviewed.

** STRT Purpose of the Study 						:sec:
#<<intro-purpose>>
There is extensive literature on the causes and the remedies of the achievement gaps (see [[lit-review][Section 2.1]]).  I do not intend to add to this crowded field, but desire to approach the subject from a different perspective, namely by performing an analysis of the political discourses at the federal level of this subject.

Thus, the objective of the study is to document and analyze the justifications given by the federal institutions of the United States for governmental control of mathematics education as function of the achievement gaps in mathematics. This was done in the light of two closely related social conditions. [add!!!] More precisely, I wanted to shed light on the discourses made in the public arena that have legitimized this control and firmly established in the national conscience that the knowledge of mathematics is essential to the prosperity, nay the survival of the nation.

What I am not concerned with is whether the above events and phenomena are the manifestations of an actual, real worsening of the situation in schools in the U.S.A..  I am interested in the *perception* of the health of the public schools by the citizens in general and of the political and economic leadership specifically.  Whether a phenomenon is a /problem/ or not is but a social construct.  Intrinsically nothing is a problem because a problem is a value statement and thus is historically and socially determined.  Furthermore, even if we grant that, e.g., a downtrend in national average SAT mathematics scores is a problem, it still may be a statistical artifact that has only mathematical validity, but does not refer to anything  meaningful in the real world.  Thus, it could be stated, using Foucaultian terminology, that I am problematizing the problematization of the achievement gaps \cite<see e.g.>{Stumbo:2008a,Gutierrez:2008a}.

Research on the achievement gaps is extensive, and research on the political aspects of the AGs also exists \cite<e.g.>{Apple:1992a,Payne:1999a}, there has been limited research on political discourse regarding the mathematics achievement gap \cite{Martin:2003a,Ellis:2005a}. Very little scholarly research has also been published on Foucault's governmentality and the achievement gaps \cite{Suspitsyna:2010a}. Others have utilized Foucault's concepts without making specific reference to governmentality \cite{Klaf:2010a,Hursh:2007a,Lashaw:2010a}. Ian \citeA[p. 143]{Hunter:1996a} about 5 years ago stated that "Foucault's later work has, to date, had relatively little influence on educational research."

The answers to these questions may be of value to the decision makers, the teaching professionals and educational researchers.

** STRT Relevance of the Study						:sec:
#<<intro-relevance>>
Even though schools teach a wide variety of subjects, the centre of attention has been on the teaching of the English language and mathematics.  Both fields of knowledge are considered vital for our national security and prosperity.  Of these two subjects the pre-eminent one has been the teaching of English, which is the "unofficial official" language of the nation.  The latest wave of immigration into the U.S.A. distinguishes itself from the previous ones by being less eager to relinquish its native language in favour of English.  However, more recent harsh economic realities have shifted the spotlight to the teaching and learning of mathematics.  This academic subject is considered to be critical for the formation of a workforce capable of participating and succeeding in a competitive and technologically advanced economic system that now spans the entire planet.

The achievement gap is now an indelible part of the public discourse on education at all levels. Two are the major markers of this phenomenon. The first one is the publication in 1983 of the report /A Nation at Risk/ \cite{NCEE:1983a},[fn:3] and the second one is the passing of the "No Child Left Behind" Act of 2001.[fn:109] The topic in closely intertwined with burning issues of the U.S. social life such as de-industrialization, globalization, and what can be called the disappearance of "well-paying jobs" for those having only a high school degree or less.[fn:4]

A recent example of the popularity of the subject is an article on /The New York Times/ by Sol Garfunkel & David Mumford dated 24 August 2011 (http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/25/opinion/how-to-fix-our-math-education.html)

There is widespread alarm in the United States about the state of our math education. The anxiety can be traced to the poor performance of American students on various international tests, and it is now embodied in George W. Bush’s No Child Left Behind law, which requires public school students to pass standardized math tests by the year 2014 and punishes their schools or their teachers if they do not.

A visual representation of the level of interest in the subject of the mathematics achievement gaps is give by /Google Books NGram Viewer/ (http://ngrams.googlelabs.com).  These graphs display over time the frequency of occurrence of certain words or word groups in the corpus of U.S. books.  Figure \ref{fig:ME-AG} shows the trend of occurrence of the bigrams "math education" and "achievement gap" and Figure \ref{fig:global-competition} shows the same for the bigram "global competition".  It is obvious that these subjects have become more and more popular since the 1960s.

If I had describe in a nutshell my study, I would state that it is but a commentary on /The Republic/ of Plato focused on the following two statements[fn:97]

[525bc] Then this is a kind of knowledge which legislation may fitly prescribe; and we must endeavor to persuade those who are prescribed to be the principal men of our State to go and learn arithmetic, not as amateurs, but they must carry on the study until they see the nature of numbers with the mind only; nor again, like merchants or retail-traders, with a view to buying or selling, but for the sake of their military use, and of the soul herself; and because this will be the easiest way for her to pass from becoming to truth and being.

[405a] And yet what greater proof can there be of a bad and disgraceful state of education than this, that not only artisans and the meaner sort of people need the skill of first-rate physicians and judges, but also those who profess to have had a liberal education?  [405b] Is it not disgraceful, and a great sign of want of good-breeding, that a man should have to go abroad for his law and physic because he has none of his own at home, and must therefore surrender himself into the hands of other men who he makes lords and judges over him?

I these statements have been my starting point for a journey of investigation that will encounter some great minds, most of them well know and others less so, until we arrive at today's discourse about the national value of mathematical knowledge 

One pervasive aspect of the political discourse in the U.S.A. has been funding, even though it is but one of the levers that the federal government has.  However, it is an important one because it shows a concrete commitment and involvement of political power. Schooling, be it public or private, requires significant financial resources. Functioning schools need money for, among others, teachers and staff payroll, premises, sports fields, buses, books, furniture, cafeteria and office supplies, musical instruments, computers and software, and gym equipment. As we have above mentioned, today in the U.S.A. its citizens generally consider it normal that, in one form or another, society has to provide all this money so that all residents in the country have access to free and universal education from kindergarten to 12th grade.  In addition, as reported previously, the U.S.A. is very generous in its public support compared to most other countries in the world.

The federal budget by definition is limited, even if in the case of the United States still very large \cite[p. 50]{Hanushek:2009a}.  This engenders fierce competition for resources between federal departments, agencies, programs and grants.  The outcome of this process of allocation depends on the relative influence and authority of competing constituencies.  The primary and largest items in the federal budget are defense, Medicare & Medicaid, and interest on the federal debt.  That ensures that the competition for the remainder of the budget be intense.  Education has to compete with infrastructures, environmental protection, international assistance, law enforcement, block grants, R&D, and a whole host of other interests.

The battle field for this struggle for funding is the public mind.  The sphere of public discourse where attention has to be sought by the use of more or less cogent logic and by the appeal to certain sentiments that are more or less noble.

So, how has the teaching of mathematics fared in this competition for funds?  Why would a government allocate any money at all to this task, what are the justifications for it in the public discourse \cite<see e.g.>[p. 51]{Doherty:2006a}.  In addition, it is helpful to look into the past for any trends and new ideas on this subject.  Some concepts and ideas are novel, others reach back into the past albeit often being called differently.

The teaching of mathematics is in a peculiar situation.  Few school children would choose to study it if they were free to choose.  Many adults would be of the same opinion.  Most adults consider themselves deficient in mathematics.  Basically it is a field of knowledge that few are interested in and knowledgeable about.  On the other hand, mathematics is with English the most frequently tested school subject.  It is in *all* standardized tests: SAT, ACT, GRE, etc.  It is with English a measured subject in the "No Child Left Behind" Act of 2001.[fn:107]

Literacy and numeracy have been considered valuable fields of knowledge since ancient times. However, the learning of reading and writing has always been the primary and often the only skill that was taught. The learning of mathematics was considered much less important than the learning of one's mother tongue and the /lingua franca/.[fn:19] Often the teaching of mathematics was considered unnecessary for the normal students and reserved for the élite. Moreover, when the learning of mathematics was enjoined it was for reasons far from today's concerns.  Plato considered the mathematics of "merchants and retail-traders" a form of knowledge inferior to that which was required of the military and state leaders, who should "study until they see the nature of numbers with their mind only" (Plato, /The Republic/ 525bc).  This attitude towards mathematics lasted until recent times and can still be recognized in the educational polemic called /The Math Wars/ \cite<see e.g.>{Latterell:2005a}.

This study tries to understand the reasons given for the allocation by the government of large amounts of money for mathematics education as well as the centralization of the control over the educational process. Both functions are not part of the U.S. constitution.  From the founding of the nation, education has been understood as a local activity in which parents would have preponderant if not total control. The first person known to have written on the public support of education was the Greek philosopher Plato. He presents his ideas on the instruction of children and young people in /The Republic/ (380 BCE) and /The Laws/ (355-347 BCE).[fn:8] There he affirmed the importance of the support by the state for the study of certain subjects. The justification for this financial support is that this kind of knowledge, at least among the ruling elite and military officers, is of vital national importance. Of course, it should be noted that in the Greece of that time the nation was equivalent to the city-state.[fn:43]

It should be noted that the socio-political program envisioned by /The Republic/ was never implemented in the Greek world.  It might even have been intended as an impossible allegory of what should be, but could not be.  It took many years for the idea of public support for schools to become reality.

Once this idea was accepted by society, it became more and more pervasive and it is inconceivable today to reverse its course.[fn:95] Even the most conservative of politicians, who would abolish the public school system, still advocate for some type of financial support, e.g. vouchers. All recent presidents and presidential candidates, governors and gubernatorial candidates, senators, congress members and so on, have made sweeping statements in support not only of public funding for education, but also to increase its level.  The situation today is that the funding per K-12 student in the U.S.A. is among the highest in the world \cite{OECD:2005a,OECD:2010a}.

By studying how society came to value the teaching of mathematics from total neglect to its privileged position today, I believe that we can obtain insights in the relevance of today's mathematics education and for its central place in school curricula.

It has been noticed with dismay by many that none of the many educational reforms in education in general, and in mathematical education in particular, have ameliorated the supposedly dire situation in the nation's classrooms. Many have tried to untangle the many possible reasons for these failures and a wealth of reforms, remedies, corrections, improvements, and changes have been proposed.  I certainly do not pretend to have the right answer, or even *an* answer.  I do however intend to offer this study as a means to look at the problem from a different view point. I hope that its reading may spark some insight, some original way of examining these complex issues.

Some think that the school system, especially the *public* school system is apart or above politics. That it is an impartial system where all have the same opportunities. That it is a quintessential democratic, non-elitist, and egalitarian institution.  However, many have realized that this is not the case. During an interview of Michel Foucault and Noam Chomsky,[fn:9] Foucault said the following

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
But I think that the political power is also exerted by a few other institutions which seem to have nothing in common with the political power, which seem to be independent but which actually aren't. We all know that the universities and the whole educational system that apparently are supposed to distribute knowledge, we know that the educational system maintains the power in the hands of a certain social class and exclude the other social class from this power.

A more extensive commentary on schools was given by Pierre Bourdieu during an interview given in 1991.[fn:10]  I translated some parts that I consider relevant to the issue of the national achievement gap[fn:11]

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
PB: For example we can observe that the inequality in school achievement can not be completely explained by economic (financial) inequalities. Thus I had to invent a concept and call it "cultural capital."  That is the concept that we inherit from our family not only material means but also instruments of knowledge, of expression, of "savoir faire," modes and manners of work, for example, that are unconsciously transmitted by the family and that contribute enormously to the academic success.  That is because the school system requires without giving them to the students.  A simple example is work skills. I think that one for the greatest advantages of the children of intellectual categories in addition to that they hear in their families a language that is close to the language that is spoken in school, and that the school requires, is the fact that they have an attitude of relationship with culture very close to what is required in school and the fact that they receive from their families indications and encouragements concerning work and time management.  These things that apparently are of little importance, almost nothing, in reality are among the decisive factors that differentiate.  It is the art of work.  Schools give very little of this, because they do not have the time, and also because the teachers do not realize its importance.  The majority of the teachers are not aware that that is what is lacking.

PB: Clearly, that is one of the extraordinary paradoxes that I have indicated in the first book that I have dedicated to education.  This is a teachers note in the margin of a page (student essay), which is hideous even though you do not think about it.  A teacher who wrote on the margin: "scolaire" (unimaginative, unoriginal).

That means that the school system does not value what the school system itself transmits. It requires something else.  It does not consider sufficient what it gives.

We could obtain the idea that this system has intentions, that there is an evil will, a kind of evil, diabolic, perverse genie.  The worst is that these social mechanisms do not have a "will", they do not have a "subject" (des méchanismes, non des volontes). There is no conspiracy. Unfortunately one of the wrong ways to understand sociology is to transform the analysis of the mechanisms into an analysis of will.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We say "it is the dominant class that eliminates..." That is a mistake that even sociologists make and those I criticize. They say "the school eliminates." That is not true.  It is the logic of the functioning of complicated mechanisms, there exists an unconscious in those mechanisms that determines that an certain kind of children are not by chance more eliminated than others.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
School reforms fail because we look for those who are responsible, who are culpable.  In reality there are differential responsibilities that are most often responsibilities inscribed in the structures in a complicated manner that are above the capacity of the agents. That does not mean that The agents are not capable of doing something.  By becoming aware they can oppose these mechanisms, avoid to unconsciously serve them (Connaitre ce méchanisme et en enrayer l'éfficatité).

The effort I devoted to this research was inspired by the statement of Michel Foucault "To change something in the minds of people--that is the role of an intellectual." \cite[p. 10]{Martin:1988a}.

# Alla fine
Summarizing, in this study I shine light on the discourse that occurs when a nation bases its prosperity and future on technology it will place the teaching of mathematics alongside the teaching of the official language in the preservation and enhancement of its national sovereignty. The knowledge of the national language is necessary for internal cohesion and the survival of the culture, while the knowledge of mathematics is essential for its survival as a nation in an environment where commerce, finance, and technology are vital.

Thus it is evident that there is a 'connection' between the state of mathematics education and some social and cultural conditions in the U.S.A..  However, I dispense with any pretension of being able to explain the historical phenomenon "the policy of mathematics teaching" by any attribution to specific causal mechanism(s). The difficulty of establishing causality does not imply that causality does not exist. However, attribution of causes in history is usually more an indication of the historian's political and ideological ideas than any reference to the discovery of any actual causal agent that connects without any solution of discontinuity the events and at the same time also completely exhausts all effects and influences of a particular historical event.

We all are aware that if we ask the apparently simple question such as "what is the cause of homelessness in the U.S.A. today?" we obtain all sorts of answers. Usually we will be able to discern a pattern between these answers and political opinions. Moving to a subject closer to our theme, let us ask "what are the causes of the lack of satisfaction of mathematics teaching in the public schools of the U.S.A. today, and what it its solution?"

Among the causes of this uneasiness I identify the emotions of fear and pride. I understand these emotions to operate at various levels, starting with the fear for the welfare of one's offspring \cite[p. xiii]{Wagner:2008a} to the fear of the survival of one's nation \cite<see>{NCEE:1983a}.[fn:72] The basic emotion of fear is related to the higher emotion of pride. In this situation it could be the feeling of being a good parent, the gladness of knowing that their children will be successful. And at a higher level of social aggregation, the knowledge that their nation is the greatest one on earth, the envy of all other countries.[fn:39]

** STRT Research Position and Strategy 					:sec:
#<<intro-research-position>>
I think that one of the aspects that makes the choice of governmentality as a framework so interesting in the study of education policy is that the theory brings to light the /mentality/ of the phenomena under examination. The principles of governmentality state that the form and modes of government are in their essence unnatural, to a certain degree arbitrary, and in their totality a product of historical contingencies. I find it stimulating to attempt to look /from the outside in/ and to try to transcend the conventional level conversations in education. For example, one level of analysis is to determine the pros and cons of a certain type of teacher certification or the process by which a math curriculum has to be developed. However, a deeper level of analysis asks why teacher certification is important in the first place and why certain alternative choices are present and why others are not and how choices are evaluated. It also asks who is speaking about these decisions and who makes the decisions.  How are these decisions influenced and negotiated and to which rationalities and sentiments are the participants of this discourse making an appeal to?

** STRT Organization of the Study 					:sec:
#<<intro-organization>>
As we have seen in the previous section this study is primarily qualitative and secondarily quantitative.  In addition the chosen theoretical framework is the "theory" of governmentality of Michel Foucault. As we will see in [[lit-review-governmentality][Section 2.4]] governmentality is not a complete theory because it is not based on a finished book by Michel Foucault, but instead are based on two series of transcribed lectures integrated by lecture notes.  These series are now published as two books, /Security, Territory, Population: Lectures at the Collège de France, 1977-1978/ (\citeNP{Foucault:2004a} in French, \citeNP{Foucault:2009a} in English) and /The Birth of Biopolitics: Lectures at the Collège de France, 1978-1979/ (\citeNP{Foucault:2004a} in French, \citeNP{Foucault:2010a} in English).

# #########################################################
# It is possible to use several theoretical frameworks to perform this 
# political discourse analysis. Personally, I would consider relevant the 
# research and concept of the following scholars
#
# + Roland Barthes, Claude Lévi-Strauss - /mythology/
# + Michel Foucault - /power, knowledge, governmentality/
# + Antonio Gramsci, Chantal Mouffe - /hegemony, culture/
# + Immanuel Wallerstein - /World Systems Theory/
# + Pierre Bourdieu, Jacques Rancière - /culture, society/
# + Slavoj \v{Z}i\v{z}ek - /culture, symbols, ideology/
# #######################################################

However, it is best not to rely on more than one theoretical framework.  While there are many overlaps there are also differences in outlook, philosophical presuppositions and methodologies that would make the use of more than one framework problematic.  While all these researchers can contribute to our political discourse analysis I consider the concepts of /governmentality/ by Michel Foucault the most productive one \cite{Dean:1999a,Burchell:1991a,Peters:2009a,Hook:2005a}.  This approach will be discussed in the methodology chapter ([[method][Chapter 3]]).

# It may be possible to carefully and sparingly add concepts from other scholars such as from the /World Systems Theory/ of Immanuel M. \citeA{Wallerstein:2004a}.  However, I am not completely sure that would be feasible.

I would also like to make a historical comparison that I find illuminating. History does not repeat itself, but parallels and comparisons can be made that will give us some insight into a contemporary situation. In my opinion, the emotional state of the French people and as well as its government after the disaster of the Seven Years' War[fn:24] presents interesting correspondences with the contemporary United States.  I do not refer to the Vietnam War[fn:25] or even the attack of 9/11.[fn:26]  Those two disasters have never been related to the mathematical or scientific knowledge of the U.S. population. On the contrary, the tragic loss of manufacturing jobs and the abyss of the trade deficit have been connected, among many other factors, to the perceived inadequate mathematical and scientific education in the public schools. Similarly, the technological inferiority of the French artillery and the mathematical ignorance of its artillerists was considered to be one the main causes of the humiliating defeat of France.  Other interesting historical parallels that have to bear are that both the France of the 17^th century and the U.S.A. of today were considered to be the most powerful nations on earth and that both combine great national wealth with horrendous federal budget deficits.

A possible critique of my approach is the realization that any claim of causal relationship in history and sociology has to face the objection that due to the complexity of the forces in play any explanation can be sustained, and is thus in ultimate analysis meaningless. Even today we are still debating the "real" cause of the fall of the Roman Empire. In addition, any appeal to a emotions is vapid because emotions drive all human beings to perform many different actions and make many discordant choices.

I certainly agree. However, my intention is not to prove a phenomenon in a scientific, experimental sense. Rather it is to navigate through the documents of federal educational policy and history of education to study the motivations, be they openly stated or uncovered by analysis, for the financial support of mathematics education.   I attempt to understand what social, economic, military, and political conditions made those in power decide to allocate for the teaching of mathematics increasing amounts of resources.  The distribution of the federal budget is a `zero sum game.'  The decision to give money to any program or agency can only occur when the discourse that supports it becomes intelligible. When certain practices, intentions, and desires become part of the public sphere to become tacitly and implicitly part of the 'normal' functioning of society.  

What will also become apparent from the analysis of the political discourse is that in parallel to the expansion of the federal share of the education budget is the centralization of the control of education.  There is a clear historical trend from local to state to federal control.  Its significance should not be underestimated because this trend contravenes the a political principle that is heartfelt among U.S. citizens, *local control* of public affairs.  We should not forget that this issue was one of the key points of contention in the U.S. Civil War.

I use as guides some studies in education that have been done using the Foucaultian concepts of /archaeology/ and /genealogy/. Mainly \citeA{Knight:1990a} who presented their "critical appreciation of official state policies" concerning school curriculum in Australia; and Jane \citeA{Kenway:1990a} who studied how certain political forces "have all but colonized popular thinking and government policy on education in Australia." David \citeA{Blades:1997a} described and analyzed a (failed) science education reform project in Canada. More recent studies of this type in mathematics education were performed by Rong-Ji \citeA{Chen:NDa} and Thomas \citeA{Popkewitz:2004a}. However, I made great use of research on governmentality analysis in education such as by Robert \citeA{Doherty:2006a}, Tatiana \citeA{Suspitsyna:2010a} and Roy \citeA{Goddard:2010a}.

The contributions by Pierre Bourdieu in the sociology of culture are profound.  He has extensively studied school systems \cite<e.g.>{Bourdieu:1990a}.  In an interview he stated the importance of studying schools as places where in modern societies people are build (constructed) in direct relation with their families. However, in schools also social differences are constructed and different social groups guarantee their continuation.[fn:27]

Knowledge as culture has been studied in relation to hegemony between social groups by Antonio \citeA{Gramsci:1992a} and his thoughts have been updated by Chantal Mouffe \cite{Laclau:2001a} and others. While these concepts are not directly related to my investigations, they provide useful insights into the structure of society and nations as they compete through history for hegemony or mere survival. Plato thought that knowledge of abstract ideas distinguished the rulers from the mere merchants form whom numbers where only intelligible in the context of material goods. Similarly, Antonio \citeA[4.55]{Gramsci:1992a} understood that classical, abstract knowledge was the domain of the ruling class and advocated such type of education for the lower classes as a prerequisite for participation in the affairs to the nation. Pierre Bourdieu called this type of knowledge /cultural capital/ \cite[p. 30]{Bourdieu:1990a}.

Another field of inquiry that has some relevance to my topic is national mythology. The views that citizens have about their country.  Its origin and destiny, its place among the nations and in history. About its virtues and strengths.  What is good or bad for the country.  What a citizen should aspire to and become. The theoretical framework was created by Claude Lévi-Strauss, even though his view are dated. The most highly regarded contemporary study is by Roland \citeA{Barthes:1972a} on mythology.

Finally I would like to mention the related concept by Slavoj \citeA[p. 306]{Zizek:2006a} of the "state of emergency."  Clearly, the idea of a national emergency has been advanced several times to advocate for public support of the teaching of mathematics, from the French defeat in the Seven Years' War to /A Nation at Risk/.

** Miscellaneous 					      :noexport:temp:

Returning to the writings of Plato, it is remarkable how a book on, among other subjects, teaching written more than two thousand years ago on another continent can be so promptly related to today's mathematics educational controversies in the U.S.A.. We could place Plato in the camp of those who prefer a constructivist inspired way of teaching mathematics versus those who support a procedural, practical pedagogy. For instance in /The Republic/, Book VII \cite[p. 215]{Bloom:1991a} [fn:78]

** STRT The Achievement Gaps						:sec:
#<<lit-review-gap>>
In [[intro-background][Section 1.2]] I started to present the academic literature on the academic achievement gaps.  Here I expand on that presentation. A vast amount of literature exists on the achievement gaps (AGs), be it on mathematics, science, or reading, national or international gaps. I performed an ERIC EBSCO (http://www.ebscohost.com/public/eric) database search on 3 August 2012 and restricted it to peer reviewed academic journals.  A search for "achievement gap" as descriptor yielded 543 results.  Adding the term "mathematics" to the search reduced the yield to 128 papers.[fn:115] 

Among the 128 search results I obtained studies about non-US educational systems, non-K-12 grades, studies on the gender achievement gap (GAG) and the disabilities achievement gap. They were not included in the review because it is outside the scope of this study.  In the U.S.A. the GAG is not at the forefront of the political discourse and is indeed only significant in higher level mathematics and science courses in the public K-12 school system.  However, the DAG is often mentioned in the political discourse although primarily in accountability situations (see [[discussion][Chapter 7]]).  Similarly, this problematic is outside the scope of this study.  In addition I do not take monographs into account in this review.  Hence, the number of papers that were left were 69 (see [[app-lit-refs-ag][Appendix R.1]]).

I begin by classifying this large body of literature by using four dimensions (Table \ref{tbl:ag-dimensions}, page \pageref{tbl:ag-dimensions}).  The first dimension regards the type of comparison such as between nations, urban/suburban/rural, racial/ethnic, or income class.  The second dimension regards the academic subject, usually mathematics, science, or reading and composition.  The third dimension pertains to type of study such as the description or the causes of an AG, its academic or policy remedies, and so on.  The fourth dimension is the time parameter that allows us to analyze how the research interests and focus have changed over time.  Graphically it is impossible to present four dimensions at the same time. Thus, I have collapsed the dimensions into only two axes with a few categories as can be seen on Table \ref{tbl:ag-matrix} on page \pageref{tbl:ag-matrix}.  The National and International Achievement Gaps are divided into a General and a Math plus Science categories. The "general" category collects both papers where the subject is not specified and papers where more than one subject, usually mathematics and reading, but not mathematics and science, is studied. I am listing those last two subjects together because this so often happens in the literature, public discourse and also in TIMSS itself.  Each cell in the table contains the number of literature references that I discuss in this section.  On the second axis of the matrix I have grouped all topics of analysis into the two broad categories of "description and causes" and "remedies, instructional or policy".

Because of the focus of this research on educational policy, literature concerning policy studies is discussed separately in [[lit-review-policy-analysis][Section 2.3]].

# ##############################################
# 1.1 NAG-G - Description and causes - General
# ##############################################
As can be appreciated in Table \ref{tbl:ag-matrix} the most research is on the description and causes of the AGs in general.

Most of these studies try to identify the causes of the underachievement of African American students. Among these studies are \citeA{Chambers:2009a} who detected a "differential treatment by school personnel as early as elementary school."  The study by \citeA{Rowley:2011a} based on the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002 confirms the Black/White gap, but also makes the statement that among its causes is "discrimination based on race."  However, the paper itself does not offer any substantiation of racial discrimination, but rather points to the inequity of the US public schools system.  This is an almost unique US phenomenon based on the preponderance of local funding of the schools in the United States. 

A relatively recent trend in AG studies is the focus on Hispanic students. The term Latino/a is also used.  Among those studies are \citeA{Reardon:2009a}, \citeA{Heilig:2010a}, and \citeA{Madrid:2011a}.
\citeA{Gill:2011a} conducted a study where both ethnic groups, Black and Hispanic were taken into consideration.

An additional item on the topic of study dimension is the socio-economic status of the families (SES).  However, Dennis \citeA{Condron:2009a} studied both and found surprisingly that schools widen the black/white disparities but narrow the social class gaps.  He concluded that school factors affect the racial AG and non-school factors drive the income AG.  The same type of result was obtained later by \citeA{Burchinal:2011a} using a longitudinal study of elementary school students.

Among the studies about the causes and descriptions of the AGs a topic of research is the *size* of the school or the classes \cite{McMillen:2004a}.  There is a policy aspect to the size of schools and classes because it is determined by policy and funding.  Bradley \citeA{McMillen:2004a} states that 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
... the number of public schools serving the secondary grades in the U. S. has largely held steady between 23,000 and 26,000 since 1930. During that same time, however, the number of public high school students in the U. S. nearly tripled, from approximately 4.4 million to over 13 million.
As consolidation trends have created larger schools, the issue of school size has become of great interest to educators and policymakers alike.
#+END_QUOTE

Cultural aspects of the AGs were discussed by J.Q. \citeA{Adams:2005a}, \citeA{Cholewa:2008a}, and \citeA{Demerath:2010a} ...

A more focused analysis of the various immigrant groups was performed by Wen-Jui \citeA{Han:2006a}.  The author took into consideration the number of generation after immigration as well as the ethnic origin and concluded that "Child and family characteristics accounted for a large share of the differences in children's academic achievements."  Basically, some ethnic groups scored higher (e.g. East Asia) than the US average and others (e.g. Mexican) scored lower.  \citeA{Schwartz:2006a} found similarly that the country of origin was important. E.g. Russian children scored above average and children from the Dominican Republic scored lower.  However, on average immigrant students did better than native students in New York.  \citeA{Konstantopoulos:2009b} performed a rigorous correlational statistical analysis of the achievement of Asian American students and confirmed what is considered common knowledge.  The Asian-White AG is clearly in favour of the Asian American students, even though it is smaller in reading than in mathematics.  However \citeA{Pang:2011a} showed in their study on this groups of students in California that we should not consider all Asian American students as a homogeneous block, but rather need to disaggregate between subgroups.  Basically the Asian Americans can be divided into a group of above average achievers, corresponding to North East Asians (Chinese, Koreans, and Japanese) and South East Asians (Filipinos, Cambodians, Pacific Islanders, etc.) who achieve below average. Some studies on the achievement of immigrant students are even more granular.  Kathryn \citeA{Simms:2012a} studies the effect of educational selectivity of the parents.  This term denotes how the education level of the parents compares with the average in the country of origin.  The author found that educational selectivity had more explanatory power than SES.  Related to immigration is the issue of language which, not surprisingly, has an effect on achievement \cite{Han:2012a}.  The author describes how mixed bilingual students were able to close the AG, but non-English dominant bilinguals and non-English monolinguals did not.  \citeA{Halle:2012a} studied the effects of the grade at which English proficiency was attained and the AG.  The sooner that the parity was attained, the sooner that the gap was narrowed or closed.

A minor, but still important, area of research is the comparison between public and private schools.  Usually the private schools are Catholic because they are (1) a large system, and (2) unlike most private schools not for the nation's elite but for all groups of students.  \citeA{Hallinan:2010a} is an example of this kind of study.  The authors compared Catholic to public schools in Chicago with regards to the influence of poverty on student achievement.  This study showed, not surprisingly, that poverty hampers achievement, but that this effect was mitigated in Catholic schools.

Some studies are fairly technical and critique the statistical measurement of the AGs themselves.  For example Richard \citeA{Verdugo:2011a} studied the effect of dropouts on the AGs.  Because generally the weakest are those that leave the schools systems, the achievement scores look better than they actually were.

# ##########################################################
# 1.2 NAG-M - Description and causes - Mathematics/Science
# ##########################################################
Considerable research has been done on the description or causes of the mathematics AG (Table \ref{tbl:ag-matrix}).

The typical study of this type involves detailed statistical analysis where several factors are considered, race/ethnic group, SES, parental involvement, teacher, class and school size, and knowledge of English.  See \citeA{Chatterji:2005a}, \citeA{Berends:2008a}, \citeA{Long:2009a}, \citeA{Shores:2009a}, \citeA{Kieffer:2009a}, \citeA{Dunn:2009a}, \citeA{Berends:2010a}, \citeA{Braun:2010a}, \citeA{Georges:2010a}, \citeA{Abedi:2010a}, and \citeA{Riegle:2010a}.  

# ##############################
# Longitudinal stat studies
Among the most interesting type of statistical analysis is the longitudinal study.  The efficacy of NCLB on the closing of the AG was tested by \citeA{Braun:2010a} who found a modest impact.

# ####################
# school segregation
\citeA{Berends:2010a} had historical dimension in their study of the AG and showed that between 1972 and 2004 the mathematics black-white and Latino-white AGs increased.  The authors impute this phenomenon to the increase in school segregation during that period.

Sean \citeA{Kelly:2009a} studied the mathematics course taking of black students and found that they are disproportionately enrolled in lower-track courses. This difference could not be completely explained by individual or family factors.

# ####################
# public vs. private
As we have seen with the General AG, also with reference to the mathematics/science AG private schools do a better job in educating their students than public schools.

# ###########################
# teacher quality/practices
Some studies focused on the teachers and their effect on the mathematics scores.  Mack \citeA{Hines:2008a} found that students of teachers with low self efficacy had lower mathematics test scores.  In addition \citeA{Desimone:2010a} found that students with lower achievement would have teachers who spent less time on instruction.  On the other hand, \citeA{Georges:2010a} found that teaching practices had little influence on mathematics scores and at any rate had uniform effects for all students.

# #######################
# readiness for college
\citeA{Long:2009a} and \citeA{Lee:2012a}.  Jaekyung \citeA{Lee:2012a} also discussed the Math-IAG.  The author studied the effects of the AG on the possibility of obtaining 2- or 4-year post-secondary degree.

# #########
# success
While most research is focused on the problem of mathematics AG, a few will study successes such as \citeA{Stinson:2008a}.  The author did a participative study with four African American male students who were academically successful in mathematics.

# ###############
# equity
The mathematics AG is often associated with educational inequity \cite{Long:2009a,Hines:2008a}.  

# ##############
# Latinos
The social aspects of the mathematics AG were stressed by Elsa \citeA{Ruiz:2011a}.  The author discussed based on personal experience the importance of motivating Latino students in Algebra I.
Most of the ELL in the US public schools system are Latinos.  Thus the cultural and the linguistic issues are often connected.  Several studies have targeted the relationship between the language skills of Latinos and their mathematics AG \cite<e.g.>{Abedi:2010a}.

# ##########################################################
# 1.4 IAG-M - Description and causes - Mathematics/Science
# ##########################################################
The on-line search did not yield any papers that I classified as International AG - general subjects.  Two reasons (1) the way that I set up the search, and (3) most important international studies are TIMSS and PISA. Multinational studies such as "Progress in International Reading Literacy Study" (PIRLS, http://www.pirls.org) are not as popular.

# #####################
# statistical studies
As usual the most popular type of research is this subject in the statistical study of data from TIMSS \cite{Wang:2003a,Chudgar:2009a,Heuveline:2010a}, or PISA \cite{Perry:2009a}. Often hierarchical linear modelling was employed for TIMSS data \cite{Lee:2010a,Heuveline:2010a}.

An interesting statistical study was performed by \citeA{Chudgar:2009a} who looked at both differences between countries and within countries with respect to SES of the families.  In most cases the schools are less important than the family situation in explaining student achievement.  Similarly, \citeA{Lee:2010a} found that the international gap is due to school factors, but family factors explain differences between states in the US.

# ########
# equity
\citeA{Perry:2009a} was an in depth statistical study that focused on equity and found the following results that have interesting policy implications:
(1) Academic selectivity in school admittance policies in compulsory education is strongly associated with inequitable outcomes, but not necessarily overall performance.
(2) Selective schooling does not always reproduce social status.
(3) high levels of privatization and choice are not necessarily incompatible with educational equity, although they may diminish it.
(4) Income inequality within the larger society does not appear to be strongly associated with equitable student maths achievement in OECD countries.

# ###################
# family influence
\citeA{Heuveline:2010a} studied the relationship between family structure and mathematics achievement. As expected, single parent children scored lower.  However, in the U.S.A. this gap was larger than in 13 other countries.

# ######################
# 2.1 NAG-G - Remedies
# ######################
Several projects were implemented with the primary or secondary aim to reduce or even eliminate the AGs. These were implemented at various levels, single school \cite{Beecher:2008a,Bruce:2009a}, school district \cite{Burris:2008a,Lopez:2010a}, and even larger geographical size \cite{Konstantopoulos:2009a,Smith:2012a}. What is common to all these successes is the requirement of a considerable amount of resources, the adoption of interactive whiteboard technology \cite{Lopez:2010a}, a complete restructuring a of a school \citeA{Beecher:2008a}, group counselling \cite{Bruce:2009a}, more advanced classes such as IB courses \cite{Burris:2008a}, class size reduction \cite{Konstantopoulos:2009a}, and summer programs \cite{Smith:2012a}.

The main objective of NCLB was to eliminate the AGs. \citeA{Lee:2012b} performed a longitudinal statistical study using hierarchical linear modelling of NAEP data to determine the impact of NCLB on the reading and mathematics AGs.  Their results were in line with the previously mentioned research in that school resources were more influential than the instruments of the reform law, accountability, data tracking, and standards.  This paper has policy implications and will thus be re-examined in [[lit-review-policy-analysis][Section 2.3]]. 

# ######################
# 2.2 NAG-M - Remedies
# ######################
Can instructional practices reduce the mathematics or science AGs?  That is, can we and by how much can schools reduce these gaps? To answer this question Harold \citeA{Wenglinsky:2004a} performed a hierarchical linear modelling study on a national sample.  He found that instructional practices could make large differences even after the personal background of the students was taken into consideration.  Similar results were obtained by \citeA{Crosnoe:2010a,Clarke:2011a}, by \citeA{Santau:2011a} in science, and by \citeA{Boaler:2008a} in California.  Other types of school intervention have been tried with success, such as "ethnic matching" of African American students with African American teachers \cite{Eddy:2011a}.

However, supplementary programs were also found to have a positive effect \cite{Lee:2009a}.  Similarly, the use of computers is both a school as well as extra-school activity and again was able to narrow the mathematics AG according to a national longitudinal study \cite{Kim:2010a}.

With the relatively recent influx of immigrants with low English language skills, often a strategy used in the closing of the mathematics AG is to act on the English language skills, after all almost all standardized tests are written in English \cite{Kim:2010a,Santau:2011a}. Sometimes teachers receive ELL training or use special instructional practices targeted to ELLs \cite{Pray:2011a}. As we will see later NCLB provides exclusions and deferrals for English language learning (ELL) students.

\citeA{Alson:2006a} presents a personal case study, which however interesting has the limitation that it is not reproducible, even though most studies in education at a certain level share this limitation.

It seems that very few programs have been implemented to narrow the IAG. \citeA{Tabernik:2010a} studied the effect of teacher professional development in Ohio on the international mathematics achievement gap.

# RESEARCH AG-G
# Part of the academic literature is about the achievement gaps in general (AG-G) and not about a specific AG type and consists either of monographs \cite<e.g.>{Chubb:2002a,Murphy:2009b,Williams:2003a}, articles \cite<e.g.>{Levitt:2004a,Murphy:2009a,White:2009a}, or reports \cite<e.g.>{Kewal:2007a}.

# There are studies that have focused on the national AG in general (NAG-G) and will thus examine NAEP scores, sometimes in combination with state standardized testing \cite<e.g.>{Linton:2003a}.  Other studies were performed on the international AG (IAG-G) and analyzed TIMSS and PISA data. Examples of such reports and articles are \citeA{Schmidt:1998a} and \citeA{Wang:2001a} on mathematics and science. Tony \citeA{Wagner:2008a} recently wrote a whole monograph on the IAG and proposed some remedies (chp. 6).

# RESEARCH AG-FUNDING
# However, I have not been able to find any scholarly literature on the relationship of the AG and the funding of mathematics education.  We have to realize though that (1) the majority of revenue of public schools is of local origin, and (2) this local funding is not subject specific, but rather funds the schools and school districts /in toto/.  Most of the federal funding of public education comes through Title I \cite<see>{Borman:1996a,Candal:2009a}, and some from other funding agencies such as the NSF.  

# RESEARCH AG-M
# There has been considerable interest in the investigation of the cause(s) of the mathematics AG (AG-M) \cite<e.g.>{Cooper:2006a}.  Often these studies use sophisticated statistical tools such as Binary Logistic Regression \cite{Balfanz:2006a}, Multivariate Analysis \cite{Bali:2003a,Bali:2004a}, Structural Equation Modeling \cite{Borman:2002a}, complex correlation and regression \cite{Rindermann:2009a}, or Hierarchical Linear Modeling \cite{Wenglinsky:2004a}.

# ELIMINATE
# Also great effort has been expended on how to eliminate, or at least narrow the mathematics AGs through instructional levers, see \citeA{Balfanz:2006a,Miranda:2007a,Holloway:2004a,Wenglinsky:2004a,Berry:2009a,Haycock:2001a,DiGisi:2005a,Nathan:1983a,Johnson:2006a,Spielhagen:2006a,Spielhagen:2006b,Beecher:2008a,Glassman:1990a,Rothman:2001a,Rumberger:1992a,Treisman:2001a,Woodward:2006a}. 

# Often the researchers will admit that they disregard the study of the causes due to the complexity of the analysis and thus it would not be reasonable to base instructional instruments on such uncertain conclusions \cite<see e.g.>{Singham:2003a}.  Some studies have found, however, that little can be done to reduce the NAG using educational levers \cite{Bali:2003a}.

# Other studies focused on the positive or exemplary cases.  They studied schools that were considered successful, be they in the U.S.A. or abroad and tried to distill the characteristics that made them superior \cite{Barber:2007a}. Similarly, there is a series of studies that do not focus on the reason(s) for the AGs, but rather on how to eliminate them \cite{Spielhagen:2006b}.

# INEQUALITIES, SOCIAL, POLITICAL
# A subset of these studies has focused on issues of inequities as the chief cause of the AG and thus have a distinctively socio-political outlook, rather than an instructional-curricular one \cite{Braun:2006a,Carlyle:2009a,Hursh:2007a}.  In this regard, a study by Linda \citeA{Bol:2005a} is very interesting because it showed that teachers had a propensity to give more weight social factors, but that supervisors and university faculty would consider curriculum and instruction more important.

# FUNDING
# Some educational researchers will discuss funding of schools \cite{Borman:1996a}. Often insufficient funding is considered to be an important cause of the AG and its increase is thus an important instrument for its resolution \cite{Apple:1992a,Jordan:2003a,Payne:1999a}. Gloria \citeA{Ladson:2007a}, who investigated funding disparity, placed this issue among larger social variables such as health and wealth and thus uses the term "gap" for all of them.  It is understandable that any analysis of funding is inherently a political discourse.

# A line of educational research is concerned with funding vis-à-vis equity rather than the AG /per se/. The unequal funding of schools in the U.S.A. has been the subject of educational research and some such as \citeA{Augenblick:1997a} and Michael \citeA{Rebell:2008a} have made an oblique reference to an "educational adequacy", the emphasis has been on social justice and not the elimination of the NAG.  \cite{Augenblick:1997a,Kahle:1998a,Rebell:2008a}.  As we have seen, disparity of school funding is peculiar to the U.S.. Hence, equity is considered important in its own right as a constituent of a modern society which should be equitable.  However, it is generally accepted now that there is a strong relationship between what we could call the "funding gap" and the "achievement gap" and that low achievement is but a reflection of poor schools and it is well known that Hispanics and Afro-Americans reside disproportionately in poorer school districts. However, see \cite{Peevely:1999a} for contrasting evidence.

# This line of thought is rejected by those who do not consider the cause of the AG to be due to resources, but rather to school practices \cite{Redding:1991a,Reeves:2003a,Singham:2003a}.

# BELIEFS
# Another type of study is the investigation of beliefs, perspectives and attitudes of the teachers and school administrators on the AGs \cite{Bol:2005a,Carlyle:2009a}.  Even though their opinions are not based on any rigorous or critical examination of the data, they are valuable and informative \cite{Bol:2005a,Rousseau:2003a}.

# DOUBTING TESTING
# Finally, some researchers seriously doubt the validity and usefulness of using standardized testing (NAEP, PISA, TIMMS) to gauge the AGs \cite{Carlyle:2009a,Rotberg:1998a}.  Others question the relationship between test scores and quality of education \cite{Chen:2010a}.

# SCHOOL REFORM
# If we slightly shift our gaze from the AGs to a closely related issue, namely school reform, then we encounter some very interesting political analyses. For instance an incisive critique was presented by David \citeA[p. xiii]{Gabbard:2000a} who wrote

# #+BEGIN_QUOTE
# To challenge the belief that a people's economic development proceeds in direct proportion to their level of educational achievement poses a threat of heresy against one of the most fundamental principles in modern secular theology. Precisely because education and development each implies a process resulting in some form of favorable change, we may properly speak of them as separate values. However, whereas education has a history of conceptual evolution separate from that of development, their evolutionary paths have since merged and congealed into one of the great and sacred certainties of our era. Nowhere, perhaps, has this belief taken stronger hold than in the United States, where the educational reform initiatives of the 1980s and 1990s have now elevated this belief to canonical status.
# #+END_QUOTE

# He continued his incisive critique with

# #+BEGIN_QUOTE
# At least two approaches present themselves for casting doubt on this sacred truism. The first entails an inquiry into the truthfulness of the claim. Since the National Commission on Excellence in Education released /A Nation at Risk/ in 1983, corporate elites and elected officials have orchestrated a massive propaganda campaign aimed at convincing the public that schools are, at once, the cause and the cure for their economic insecurity. In typical fashion, the media very obediently assisted in facilitating this fraud, helping to further entrench the belief that a people's economic development proceeds in direct proportion to their level of educational achievement. Not only has the media helped to spread this secular theology, it has also protected it from any serious public scrutiny by failing to report any of the most elementary facts that would call its presuppositions to question.[fn:98]
# #+END_QUOTE

# Gerald \citeA{Bracey:2003c} published an analysis that were very similar to Gabbard's. In the same book, Thomas \citeA{Popkewitz:2000a} provided discussion of school reform according to a Foucaultian prospective, Karen \citeA{Barnhardt:2000a} discussed the idea of "crisis" in US politics and culture, and Steve \citeA{Tozer:2000a} the concept of class that I find useful in my data analysis.  Seymour \citeA{Sarason:2003a} has also pointed out the "intractability of school reform" in his anthology. For instance he wrote (2003, p. 252)

# #+BEGIN_QUOTE
# When over a period of time a condition has been intractable to efforts to improve it, it is a sure-fire sign that something is radically wrong with the assumptions on which our actions are based.
# #+END_QUOTE

# As I have shown previously and will discuss more extensively later (ref??), rarely is the concept of class or income gap used.  However, some researchers have investigated the instructional situation of poor students \cite<see e.g.>{Mertens:2003a,Bracey:2002a}. 

# SCHOOL POLICY AND PHILOSOPHY
# Finally, there are studies that approach the subject from a more distant viewpoint that are helpful in my investigations \cite<see e.g.>{Valero:2004a}. For instance, Joseph \citeA{Dunne:2005a} who wrote a chapter in \citeA{Carr:2005a} entitled "What's good of education?".  Joe \citeA{Kincheloe:1999a} wrote a political analysis describing how in U.S. workers made to be part of the economic systems through a variety of institutions, among which are the public schools and more specifically vocational schools. Jonathan \citeA{Kozol:1991a,Kozol:2006a} has written very critically about the public school system. Gloria \citeA{Ladson:2006a} discussed the AG and argued that we should instead focus on what she named the "education debt".  Kristi \citeA{Garrett:2009a} recently wrote that to really close the AGs it is imperative to talk about race.

# Some researchers have done what I intend to do, that is the "problematization of the problematization" of the AGs \cite<see e.g.>{Martin:2003a,Bracey:1998a,Bracey:2003a,Bracey:2003b,Bracey:2003c}.  

# Sometimes even those who only invoke the use of instructional tools will have to engage in political discourse.  For instance, often Charter Schools are presented as a solution because they offer instructional flexibility and can thus, according to their proponents, adapt to the needs of low-achieving students \cite{Nathan:1983a}.  Evidently, support of charter schools is a political stance.  Some, less trusting, scholars have stated that an appeal to educational changes is but a thinly veiled disguise for a political agenda be it more "liberal" or "conservative" \cite{Bracey:2003c}.

# POLITICO-SOCIAL knowledge/teaching mathematics 
# Another interesting field of study in mathematics education is the politico-social function of the knowledge of mathematics and the drives in teaching it \cite{Namukasa:2004a,Walshaw:2004a}.  In the examination of the political dimensions of mathematics education I find very useful the use of a concept introduced by Michel Foucault called /governmentality/.  There are a few researchers who have used this concept in education research such as Robert \citeA{Doherty:2006a}, \citeA{Peters:2009a}, and \citeA{Popkewitz:2007a}.

** STRT Discourse Analysis 						:sec:
#<<lit-review-da>>
This is not the place to present a complete literature review of discourse analysis (DA), not even restricting it to educational research.  It simply would be too vast and not even relevant to this investigation.  Thus, I have here limited the literature analysis to the discourse analysis of the achievement gaps.

An on-line database search for "discourse" and "achievement gap" as a descriptor among peer reviewed publications yielded 38 results.[fn:118]  I removed those articles that were not US based studies, not K-12 studies, about DAG and GAG, or were not actually discourse analysis of the AGs.  This reduced the number of papers to 16 (see \ref{tbl:ag-discourse}, page \pageref{tbl:ag-discourse}) going back to the year 2006.

We can analyze these papers according to two "dimensions", the subject and the speaker of the discourse.  We can thus arrange these articles into a matrix as shown in Table \ref{tbl:da-matrix} on page \pageref{tbl:da-matrix}.  Please notice that some papers may appear in more than one cell of the matrix.

The majority of the research on the Discourse Analysis of the AGs has been on the general national achievement gaps.  The "voices" whose discourses were analyzed were the in the first place teachers, school administrators and staff \cite{OConnor:2006a,Au:2008a,Noguera:2008a,OConnor:2009a,Zion:2011a,McMahon:2011a,Martinez:2011a,Gorski:2012a}, and the educational researchers themselves \cite{Ladson:2006a,OConnor:2009a,Parks:2009a,Mocombe:2011a,Hughes:2012a,Gorski:2012a}.  More rarely were the voices of the students analyzed \cite{Irizarry:2011a,Stinson:2008a} and of the politicians and community activists \cite{Kovacs:2008a,Aleman:2009a}.

** STRT Educational Policy Analysis					:sec:
#<<lit-review-policy-analysis>>
In this section I present a literature analysis of papers written on the subject of educational policy that are relevant to the ethnic/income and international achievement gaps.

I performed an ERIC EBSCO search for "achievement gap" and "policy analysis" as descriptors and restricted the results to peer reviewed journal articles and obtained 19 results.[fn:116]   Then I removed studies that were not about the US K-12 education system and those that were not policy analyses, which reduced the number to 9.  The results are presented in Table \ref{tbl:ag-policy} in [[app-lit-refs-pol][Appendix Section R.3]] (page \pageref{tbl:ag-policy}). This appendix table also contains 10 previously selected papers.  The research papers can be categorized by type of AG and subject of study as is shown in Table \ref{tbl:policy-matrix-nag} on page \pageref{tbl:policy-matrix-nag} and Table \ref{tbl:policy-matrix-iag} on page \pageref{tbl:policy-matrix-iag}, or by type of AG and study methodology (Table \ref{tbl:policy-matrix-2}, page \pageref{tbl:policy-matrix-2}).

The watershed policy that now clearly separates US educational policy in two periods is of course NCLB which was signed by President George Bush on 8 January 2002.  Among the selected papers only one precedes this law \cite{Farkas:2000a}.  This is a paper sponsored by the Brookings Institution [fn:117] and which already prefigures an important aspect of NCLB the concepts of accountability and state or local control and flexibility.

There are several subjects of policy analysis on the AGs.  Most of them hinge on ESEA and especially on its Title I \cite{Farkas:2000a}.  \citeA{Farkas:2000a} performed an extensive analysis of school and school district political culture and is an interesting description of a pre-NCLB situation.

** STRT Governmentality							:sec:
#<<lit-review-governmentality>>
# ###########################
# Wikipedia <- sources
# ###########################
An ERIC EBSCO database search for the terms "governmentality" and "achievement gap" did not yield any result even when non peer reviewed and non journal articles were included and the search was for the complete text of the source.  Thus, I will now give a basic description of the concept of governmentality based on Michel Foucault himself.  He himself described /governmentality/ according to three "dimensions" \cite[pp. 108-109]{Foucault:2009a}

1. The ensemble formed by the /institutions/, /procedures/, /analyses and reflections/, the /calculations and tactics/ that allow the exercise of this very specific albeit complex form of power, which has as its /target/ population, as its principal /form of knowledge/ political economy, and as its essential /technical means/ apparatuses of security.

2. The /tendency/ which, over a long period and throughout the West, has steadily led towards the pre-eminence over all other forms (sovereignty, discipline, etc) of this type of power which may be termed government, resulting, on the one hand, in /formation of a whole series of specific governmental apparatuses/, and, on the other, in the development of a whole /complex of savoirs/.

3. The process, or rather the /result of the process/, through which the state of justice of the Middle Ages, transformed into the /administrative state/ during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, gradually becomes 'governmentalized'.

Foucault did not publish any book or paper specifically on /governmentality/ and all we know is based on his lectures at the Collège de France. Later scholars have tried to systematize and extend his ideas in books and articles.  One of the main of such works is by Mitchell \cite{Dean:1999a} who wrote that ".... the term government to Foucault meant not so much the political or administrative structures of the modern state as the way in which the conduct of individuals or of groups may be directed. To analyse government is to analyse those mechanisms that try to shape, sculpt, mobilise and work through the choices, desires, aspirations, needs, wants and lifestyles of individuals and groups."

# ###################
# Wikipedia
# ###################
Thus, if one takes these three strands together, governmentality may be defined as the process through which a form of government with specific ends (a happy and stable society), means to these ends ("apparatuses of security"), and with a particular type of knowledge ("political economy"), to achieve these ends, evolved from a medieval state of justice to a modern administrative state with complex bureaucracies.

# ####################
# Mark Bevir
# ####################
A familiar distinction has positivist social science generate causal explanations while histories and genealogies lead to an understanding of beliefs and actions. This distinction wrongly implies that genealogists are trying only to understand or reconstruct objects, not to explain them. Genealogists usually believe their narratives explain beliefs and actions by pointing to their historical causes. More generally, scholars from all sorts of disciplines use the word "cause" to describe very different explanatory relationships.  They use the word "cause" to indicate the presence of a relationship of the sort that explains the kind of object that interests them. In this view, narrative is the form of explanation that is appropriate to a historicist theory of politics. Narratives work by relating actions to the beliefs and desires that produce them and by situating these beliefs and desires in particular historical contexts
 
Narratives depend on the conditional connections between beliefs, desires, and actions. These conditional connections are neither necessary nor arbitrary. Because they are not necessary, political science differs from the natural sciences. Because they are not arbitrary, we can use them to explain actions and practices. Conditional connections exist when the nature of one object draws on the nature of another. They condition each other, so they do not have an arbitrary relationship. Equally, the one does not follow from the other, so they do not have a necessary relationship. They embody contingency (Mark Bevir, XXXX).

# This is a preliminary question of this investigation, and the most theoretical one of the six research questions.  Here I base myself on the research and understanding of educational researchers that have used the Foucaultian concept of /governmentality/.  I am referring primarily to Roy \citeA{Goddard:2010a}, Robert \citeA{Doherty:2006a}, Ian \citeA{Hunter:1996a}, \citeA{Peters:2009a}, Donald \citeA{Gillies:2008a}, Brenda \citeA{Spencer:2001a}, Michael \citeA{Peters:2007a}, Jie \citeA{Qi:1997a}, \citeA{Graham:2004a}, and Tatiana \citeA{Suspitsyna:2010a}.

In this introductory section I briefly describe the theoretical principles used to frame these questions. Then in the following sections I give a description of (1) how I obtained the data sources, (2) how they were analyzed, and (3) the tools used to perform the analysis.  A high level overview of the methodology is show in Figure \ref{fig:workflow-summary} on page \pageref{fig:workflow-summary}.

My research methods are a combination of Qualitative Data Analysis ([[method-qual-analysis][Section 3.2]]) with Text Mining (see  [[method-quant-analysis][Section 3.3]]).  Operationally I made heavy use of computer technology to assist me as much as possible with the retrieval, processing, and analysis of the data. Thus, I devoted [[method-software][Section 3.4]] to its description. I end this chapter with a detailed description of these various steps of data retrieval, processing, and analysis ([[method-analysis-steps][Section 3.5]]).

\citeA{Gough:2000a} describes /methodology/ as the "reasoning that informs particular ways of doing research, or the principles that inform the organization of research activity" (p. 3) and also as "conceptual framework or the assumptions that guide their research" (p. 3) and "reasons for using such techniques in relation to the kind of knowledge or understanding the researcher is seeking." (p. 4)  Similarly, \citeA[p. 38]{Rudestam:2007a} stated that "methodologies can be regarded as the strategies, action plans, or designs that inform the choice of specific methods, that is, procedures and techniques for data collection and analysis."

# difference methods and methodology
While often `method' and `methodology' are confused or used synonymously, Harding (as cited in \citeNP[p. 4]{Gough:2000a}) stated that in the social sciences

A research /method/ is a technique for (or a way of proceeding in) gathering evidence.  One could reasonable argue that all-evidence gathering techniques fall into one of the following three categories: *listening to (or interrogating) informants*, *observing behaviour*, or *examining historical traces and records*.  In this sense, there are only three methods of social inquiry.[fn:35]
#+END_QUOTE

Briefly stated, my study is an archival-historical research project. Thus, obviously, in my case the only method that will be used is the third one, /examining historical traces and records/. I call it /text analysis/ with the understanding that I am mostly examining written texts, which I may supplement with some audiovisual material. These /historical traces and records/ are my *data*. The kind of documents and their sources are presented in the [[method-detailed-steps-A][Subsection 3.5.1]].  This qualitative analysis will be complemented by quantitative text analysis, also called /text mining/.

The research could be understood as a hermeneutical study. Hermeneutics is the discipline that attempts to discover the meaning of a text. However, the object of study is not a text or even a corpus of texts.  The object of study is the discourse of a body politic, the U.S. government.  The meaning of the texts is certainly important and has to be taken into consideration, but it is not the focus of the study.

The study of social perceptions as evinced from public statements is clearly a study not of "objects" and not even of "behaviour," but of ideas and of discourses. Whether a statement itself is true or not is not the issue, and even its meaning defined as intent of the original author is only secondarily relevant. I am interested in understanding what counts and what does not, what is perceived as correct and what is not. However, I intend to go beyond this.  I also want to study what is not said, what is missing, or more precisely, what does not have to be said. This is the domain of "discourse analysis," especially the types of discourse analysis developed by Michel Foucault \citeA[pp. 871--872]{Perakyla:2005a}. 

Why have I chosen Foucault's among the many approaches that are available to engage in the analysis of educational policy?  To answer this question we need to recall that in qualitative studies the researcher is his or her own instrument.  The researcher's attitudes, opinions and world view are greatly influenced by the environment he or she grew up in and the emotional and intellectual experiences of life.  I have due to family history changed many times myself.  I have changed the language in which I think several times, I have changed political and religious outlooks, I have changed diet. I have even changed from being left-handed to right-handed.  Hence it comes natural to me to agree with the following statement by Mark \citeA[p. ]{Olssen:1999a}

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Critique, for Foucault, aims at identifying and exposing the unrecognized forms of power in people's lives, to expose and move beyond the forms in which we are entrapped in relation to the diverse ways that we act and think.  In this sense, critique aims to free us from the historically transitory constraints of contemporary consciousness as realized in and through discursive practices. Such constraints impose limitations that have become so intimately a part of the way people experience their lives that they no longer experience these systems as limitations but embrace them as the very structure of normal and natural human behavior.  Within these limits, seen as both the limits of reason and the limits of nature, freedom is subordinated to reason which is subordinated to nature, and it is against such a reduction of reason to nature that Foucault struggles.  His commitment is to a form of "permanent criticism" which much be seen as linked to his broader program of freedom of thought.  It is the freedom to think differently from what we already know.
#+END_QUOTE

I find it easier to discuss my methodology by starting with the methods that I have chosen.  The type of research determines the methods. The methods of an archival-historical project are text and discourse analysis.  I examine statements by politicians, political and professional organizations, corporations and think tanks.  These statements are in the form of reports, press releases, web articles and quotations and interviews by journalists of the above mentioned entities. The medium will be printed or electronic.  The form will be written or video.  In the case of spoken statements I prepare transcripts.

My paradigmatic standpoint in this research project is eminently qualitative. However, I also use some quantitative methods as a supplementary investigation as it is now possible to do statistical analysis of texts. I briefly describe this type of analysis below in [[method-quant-analysis][Section 3.3]].

At this point I would like to briefly touch the issue of ethics in educational research.  There is a branch of philosophy that studies values \cite{Gough:2000a}, and ethics \cite[p. 183]{Denzin:2005a}. Ethical considerations are never far away in the natural sciences. Consider for example research in genetics, medicine, nuclear energy, artificial intelligence, or robotics.  In the social sciences the situation is complex. We have positivist social scientists that claim that their research process is value-neutral \cite<e.g.>[Tables 8.2-4]{Guba:2005a}.  This is strongly disputed by social researchers that do not accept the positivist view of their research \cite{Howe:2009a}. It is impossible to do social research and not be concerned about values.  Kenneth \citeA{Howe:2009a} stated "Just as social research is theory-laden, it is also value-laden."  It is inescapable. After all, the statement "my research is value-neutral" is a value statement.

What is my position?   I certainly join those who state that any type of investigation has ethical implications. However, I do not intend to espouse any activist orientation. I do not espouse any particular action in educational research or policy in this investigation.  This research will undoubtedly inform, shape, and even change my personal opinions on education and its policies, but I do not want that to be an integral part of my present studies.  From an operational, methodological position, my work will follow the /Standards for reporting on humanities-oriented research in AERA publications/ \cite{Barone:2009a}.

Having said that, I want to state that I completely agree with \citeA[p. 200]{Guba:2005a} that axiology is "part of the foundational philosophical dimensions of paradigm proposal."  My work intends to assist, even in small measure, the reader to recognize in mathematics education what Pierre Bourdieu calls /symbolic violence/ \cite{Sabour:1999a}, that the knowledge it produces is a product to be sold \cite[p. 4]{Lyotard:1984a}, and that what appears to be natural, normal, a fact of life, is actually a socially inculcated way of thinking. Thus, we can reclaim some of our freedom of action.

During the final stage of the investigation I integrated the results of the qualitative data analysis (QDA), /text mining/, and literature review into a final product. The core of the end product will consist of the narratives where I describe in light of /governmentality/ how the public discourse on the mathematics achievement gaps is structured. 

I intend to avail myself of both qualitative and quantitative investigations. Why both? Because the analysis process will consist of two tracks that are parallel, but also intertwined and reinforcing, correcting, and informing each other.  It may be pictorially imagined as a caduceus, a symbol of balanced and equal exchange.  These two approaches are thus qualitative discourse analysis and statistical text analysis, also called text-mining.

The flow diagram of the research process (\ref{fig:workflow-detail} on page \pageref{fig:workflow-detail} shows the steps and their relationships in more detail than the preceding figure. Each box represents a step in the investigative process.  Green boxes represent the steps for the data retrieval and processing, red boxes the *QDA*, blue boxes the text mining, and brown boxes the conceptual processes. These steps are described in the following sections and the appendices.

** COMP Qualitative Data Analysis					:sec:
#<<method-qual-analysis>>
The analysis of qualitative data (QDA) as a strategy, activity, and set of methods is varied, but can be conceptually reduced to a series of processes.  Here I rely on the description given by John \citeA[pp. 150--155]{Creswell:2007a} of these processes that he calls collectively the "Data Analysis Spiral"

In quantitative analysis there is a clear, linear process from experimental design, through data collection, to statistical analysis, and then discussion and conclusions.  Qualitative analysis is not linear, but can be imagined as a combination of a line with a circle, resulting in a spiral as \cite{Creswell:2007a} explains. Here I show a figure from this publication (\ref{fig:spiral}) on \pageref{fig:spiral} of what Creswell calls a /data analysis spiral/.

#+CAPTION: Data analysis spiral
#+LABEL: fig:spiral
#+ATTR_LaTeX: width=10cm
[[/home/henk/Dropbox/dissertation/graphic/data-analysis-spiral.png]]

Thus, the QDA process is iterative, but at each turn the analysis has progressed.  At many steps of our analysis we have to look back at the data to modify our initial analysis, the analysis then modifies our understandings, which will then modify, shift our analytical framework, until at the end he have obtained an account or a narrative.

The first circles are about /data management/, where the researchers collect and organize their data sources, and performs the appropriate conversions and classifications.  The researchers will often group the material into categories (in my case: presidential speeches and congressional hearings) as well as giving attributes to the files (e.g. date, location, author, audience and affiliation of the author, etc.). These steps of are described in detail in appendices [[app-search-url][A]], [[app-download][B]], [[app-file-descr][C]], [[app-scrub][D]], [[app-imp-rqda][E]], [[app-file-attr][F]], and [[app-case-attr][G]].

This is followed by the /reading and memoing/ of the data, where the researchers familiarize themselves with the data by extensive reading and comparisons within the data and with the existing literature.  Often the researcher will write notes and memos and other types of comments.

The next group of loops are the core of the qualitative analysis process.  These cycles are devoted to /description, classification, and interpretation/ of the data.   The researcher will create codes, also called categories, These codes are then applied to portions of the text.  There are no precise boundaries to these codes texts.  They range from fragments of sentences to one or more paragraphs.  The number of codes also varies, often new codes are created and other are discarded during this process due to the iterative nature of qualitative analysis.  During this stage of analysis the researchers can now go "beyond" the text.  They can notice and mark dichotomies, omissions, disruptions, metaphors, allusions, and contradictions. At a later stage related codes can be grouped into categories of codes, also called themes.  At this point the researchers will begin to interpret the data.  This is a very personal and "fuzzy" process and often these interpretations will be tentative and inconclusive \cite<see>[p. 154]{Creswell:2007a}.  These steps are described in detail in [[app-qda-codes][Appendix I]].

The final phase of this analysis spiral the researchers will present their findings.  This can be done in textual, tabular, and graphical form.  Usually the report or paper will contain a mixture of these three representations.  The final product may be in the form of a narrative, a hypothesis, or a set of propositions. Again, often the final product consists of a melange of these forms.

# codes/themes are the means of correspondence between the theory and the texts

The methodology of the qualitative research flows naturally from the theoretical framework, i.e. Foucault's /governmentality/. However, the theory is a development of Foucault's /genealogy/ and genealogy itself is a form of /discourse analysis/. Hence the general theory and methods of discourse analysis apply to this investigation.

The research project included some statistical analysis of the codings. One may question the need of statistical analysis in a qualitative research project. Actually, there are several examples in the *QDA* literature where statistical analysis is used to complement the qualitative analysis. In addition the statistics will provide illustrative visual representations.

In the statistics of social sciences the two more common types of statistics are the descriptive and inferential (ref???).  The first type can be applied to almost all numerical data regardless of how it is collected.  The second type can only be used with experimental and quasi-experimental data.  Obviously I could only use descriptive statistics in this type of research.

The key to the application of statistics in QDA is the generation of numerical data. The software package that I used for QDA, called /RQDA/ (http://rqda.r-forge.r-project.org/), is able to generate the following descriptive statistics from the paragraph codings: (1) number of codings for each code, (2) average number of characters in codings for each code, (3) number of files coded for each code, and (4) number of codings for each file.

In addition cross code frequencies will be calculated. These frequencies provide a numerical representation of the relations between codes by assuming that when the same paragraph is coded by more than one code, those codes are related. These relations can be diagrammatically represented by *undirected weighted network graphs* and numerically by upper triangular matrices.  Again, the same calculations will be performed at the level of categories.

The final descriptive statistic that I intend to compute is the distribution of codes/themes among documents and within documents. This type of distribution is best displayed by a stacked bar graph.  Each bar is a document and each segment of the bar corresponds to a specific code or theme. For best visual effect each code/theme will correspond to a specific colour.  The representation will have to be adjusted for overlapping codes.  For details see [[app-codes-summary][Appendix J]].

** COMP Quantitative Data Analysis					:sec:
#<<method-quant-analysis>>
Text mining is a type of quantitative analysis, What can such an analysis provide to a study in educational policy?  Among the advantages is the capacity of analyzing *large* amounts of text.  Another positive aspect is the automated analysis.  Human judgement, distraction, mistakes, and biases do not play a part in coding and extraction of information.  \citeA{Monroe:2008a} discussed the use of statistical analysis of political texts, their advantages and their limitations. This kind of analysis is commonly called /text mining/.  Recently \citeA{Graesser:2011a} have stated

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Automated analysis of the language and discourse characteristics of texts have enormous practical value in education, in addition to advancing scientific theories of reading and comprehension.
#+END_QUOTE

We have to bear in mind that if in social sciences we intend to perform a quantitative study we are restricted to a relatively small set of data that are numeric or can be converted into a numeric form.  The reality is that the vast majority of data that social scientists are interested in are in text form and thus beyond the reach of a conventional quantitative analysis.  The possibility of somehow obtaining, abstracting, or extracting information of this large repository of data can be of great value.

# #################
In /text mining/ unlike conventional statistics we analyze text instead of numerical data.  The first step is to export the contents from *QDA* software, /RQDA/, and import into the text mining package /tm/. In addition to the text itself, the file attributes (author, date, institution, type of document, author category) will be converted into meta data.

The next step is the processing of the texts.  In this phase the following transformations are performed: (1) conversion to lower case, (2) removal of punctuation, (3) numbers, (4) stop words, and (5) white spaces.  There is a further transformation, stemming, where words are reduced to their base semantic value.  E.g. the words "achievement", "achieve", and "achieving" are reduced to "achiev".  For some single word analyses I perform this type of reduction. However, for n-gram analyzes there will be no stemming.  For instance in the case of the n-gram "achievement gap" or "global competition".  In that case a different transformation, called tokenization, will be performed.  The final product of text processing is the creation of a term-document matrix, where the rows correspond to terms and the columns to documents.  This matrix can be reduced in size by removing sparse terms.  Another optional processing transformation is the conversion of synonyms into a single term.  Some transformations may require high computing power.  In that case I avail myself of the /Brazos/ high performance computer cluster (http://brazos.tamu.edu). For details and computer code for the processing of the texts see [[app-process][Appendix L]].

The next step is the /text mining/ proper.  I intend to perform the following analyzes: (1) word and word-group frequencies, represented by tables, matrices, bar graphs, and cloud maps; (2) word and word-group associations, represented by upper triangular matrices and network graphs; (3) hierarchical clustering, represented by dendrograms; (4) word and word-group frequencies by time stamp, represented by time-line diagrams; and (5) word and word-group distributions in the data sources, represented by tables and diagrams.  For details and computer code see [[app-tm][Appendix M]].

Based on the QDA /a priori/ codes, I created a dictionary of relevant terms to perform the above analyses for the dictionary terms.  Thus, compared the /a priory/ terms with those found by statistical analysis.

# It is possible to perform more advanced text mining such as /latent semantic analysis/, /string kernels/, /principal component analysis/, and /natural language processing/. I will decide whether to perform them based on the results obtained by the QDA and conventional text mining.  For details on the text mining proper see [[appendix-j][Appendix J].

** COMP Software and Hardware Resources 				:sec:
#<<method-software>>
There are software applications that can assist the researcher in performing either qualitative or quantitative data analysis.  Even though all these steps can be performed using pencil and paper and have been done in this fashion until recent times, the use of software and computers can greatly facilitate this process.  In this section I describe in some detail the various software application that I have used for this investigation.  For more information I provide the websites for each of these applications.  [[app-software][Appendix O]] describes in detail the installation of all software applications.

*** COMP Data analysis software					     :subsec:
#<<method-software-R>>
The basis of all data analysis is an open source application called /R/ \cite{R-project:2010a} that becoming increasingly popular in academia and business.[fn:114]  I decided thus to use it for practical as well as ideological reasons. /R/ is free, multi-platform (Windows, MacOSX, UNIX/Linux), actively developed and thus frequently updated, it possesses many, many additional libraries for just about any possible statistical and data analysis application that extend its functionality.  Among them I have used /RQDA/ for qualitative data analysis, /tm/ for text mining, and /ggplot2/ for plotting.  In addition, because all three components of analysis (*QDA*, text mining, and descriptive statistics) were performed using /R/ it was easy to exchange information between these components.  On the downside, the system is somewhat difficult to use and is not as popular among social scientists as it is among statisticians and researchers in the natural sciences.

*** COMP QDA software /RQDA/					     :subsec:
#<<method-software-rqda>>
There is a category of software called "qualitative data analysis" (QDA). There are several QDA packages, both commercial and open source.  The QDA package for /R/ is /RQDA/ \cite{rqda:2011a}. The advantages of /RQDA/ are its integration with /R/ and being open source, and thus free.  From the website

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
RQDA is an easy-to-use tool to assist in the analysis of textual data. At the present, it supports only plain text format data. (....) It includes a number of standard Computer-Aided Qualitative Data Analysis features. Besides, it seamlessly integrated with R, which means that a) statistical analysis on the coding is possible, and b) functions about data manipulation and analysis can be easily extended by writing R functions. To some extent, RQDA and R makes an integrated platform for both quantitative and qualitative data analysis.
#+END_QUOTE

The use of /RQDA/ is described in detail in appendices [[app-imp-rqda][E]], [[app-file-attr][F]], [[app-case-attr][G]], [[app-case-summary][H]], [[app-qda-codes][I]], and [[app-codes-summary][J]].

*** COMP Text mining library /tm/				     :subsec:
#<<method-software-tm>>
For text mining I used the /R/ package called simply /tm/ (see http://tm.r-forge.r-project.org/).

The main statistical analyses of text mining done by /R/ are /count-based evaluation/, /term correlations/, /simple text clustering/, /hierarchical clustering/, /trend analysis/ and /text classification/.  One can consult \citeA{Feinerer:2008a,Feinerer:2008b,Feinerer:2008c} for an explanation of these terms as well as for examples of this type of analysis performed in the /R/ data analysis application \cite{Feinerer:2010a}.

The scripts used for /tm/ text mining are shown in appendices [[app-rqda2tm][K]], [[app-process][L]], and [[app-tm][M]].

*** COMP Brazos Computer Cluster				     :subsec:
#<<method-software-brazos>>
For computationally intensive tasks I used /Brazos/ a major computing cluster (HPC) at Texas A&M University (http://brazos.tamu.edu).  Brazos is a cluster of 126 Dell PowerEdge 1950 1U servers and runs the Linux operating system.  It supports several scientific and mathematical programs, among which /R/.   [[app-brazos][Appendix N]] shows the scripts and commands used to run the /R/ scripts on the computer cluster.

*** COMP Document creation with /Emacs/ and LaTeX		     :subsec:
#<<method-software-emacs>>
It was very convenient and efficient to integrate all the text writing and data analysis with one "master" software application called /Emacs/ (see http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/).

Emacs is a powerful and versatile multi-function text editor that can be extended by adding packages, such as /ESS/, to interface with /R/ (http://ess.r-project.org/).

To organize my data and help with the workflow I used a popular Emacs package named /org-mode/ (http://orgmode.org). 

To produce the final document in PDF format I used the powerful text processing system /LaTeX/ (http://www.latex-project.org).  As /R/, /LaTeX/ is more popular in mathematics, engineering and exact science research than among social sciences research.  For bibliographic references I used /BibTeX/ (http://www.bibtex.org) a bibliographic management system that works with /LaTeX/.

Emacs is also able to interface with /LaTeX/ through a package called /AUCTeX/ (http://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/). 

*** COMP File backup						     :subsec:
#<<method-dropbox>>
A very important but often overlooked computing process is the backup of the files, the data files, graphics, documents, text files and scripts.  Thanks to Dropbox (http://www.dropbox.com), a very popular form of cloud-based dynamic storage, the whole backup process was transparent and practically immediate.

** STRT Research process steps 						:sec:
#<<method-detailed-steps>>
In this section I describe in detail all the steps that were involved in the retrieval, processing, and analysis of the data sources.  Figure \ref{fig:workflow-detail} on page \pageref{fig:workflow-detail} shows graphically the workflow pertaining to those steps.

My strategy in running scripts was to use tables as much as possible. UNIX /bash/ scripts would often generate data into list format which other scripts then would use to generate more data.  This data was then formatted and loaded by /R/ scripts into the /RQDA/ project database or was used by other /R/ scripts that would do text mining or descriptive statistics and plots.

From an operational point of view there were three levels of analysis of the document collections as described in Table \ref{tbl:level-analysis} on page \pageref{tbl:level-analysis}.

#+tblname: level-analysis
#+LABEL: tbl:level-analysis
#+CAPTION: Levels of analysis of the data
#+ATTR_LaTeX: placement=[htbp]
| Level | Unit of Analysis | Descriptors     |
|-------+------------------+-----------------|
|     1 | File             | File attributes |
|     2 | Statement        | Case attributes |
|     3 | Paragraph        | QDA Codes       |
|     4 | Word             | text mining     |
|-------+------------------+-----------------|

The first is at the level of document itself.  In this stage I assigned attributes to the plain text files that were imported into the *QDA* software program, /RQDA/. This level is described in [[method-detailed-steps-F][Subsection 3.5.6]]. 

The second is the level of statement.  I define statement as a part of text that is from the same author and stems from the same written source.  In the Presidential Documents usually each file is one statement.  The exceptions are the debates, where there are two statements, one for each debater.  In /RQDA/ I use a structure called *case* to analyse these statements.  This level is described in [[method-detailed-steps-G][Subsection 3.5.7]] and [[method-detailed-steps-H][3.5.8]].

The third is the level of paragraph, defined as a portion of text between two empty lines or starting with an indentation.  In /RQDA/ I use *codes* to analyse relevant paragraphs. This level is described in [[method-detailed-steps-I][Subsection 3.5.9]] and [[method-detailed-steps-J][3.5.10]].

The fourth and lowest level are the words themselves.  I use *text mining* and the /R/ package /tm/ to perform analysis at this level. This level is described in [[method-detailed-steps-K][Subsection 3.5.11]], [[method-detailed-steps-L][3.5.12]], and [[method-detailed-steps-M][3.5.12]].

*** COMP Search FDsys & Create source lists			     :subsec:
#<<method-detailed-steps-A>>
The whole process begins with the search on the FDsys (http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/) website for the terms "education", "achievement gap" and "math".  The web site created search results pages that were saved to one or more =HTML= files.  Then /bash/ scripts extracted the URLs from these =HTML= pages and created my URL lists.  These lists were used by other /bash/ scripts that downloaded the documents.  Repeating items were removed and then sorted, and counted by /bash/ scripts so that they could be checked with the totals given for the searches on the FDsys website.

Some searches resulted in more than one page. Thus I needed to splice these pages into a single html file. The scripts will perform the merges.

In the document collection congressional hearings this search produced 217 results, which I considered excessive. Thus, I made the search more restrictive for this collection.  I performed the following three searches

1. "education" and "achievement gap" and "math" and "TIMSS"
2. "education" and "achievement gap" and "math" and "NAEP"
2. "education" and "achievement gap" and "math" and "PISA"

The first search yielded 26 results, the second one 86, and the third one 24.  I merged the three results. The total extracted URLs is 129 instead of 136 because the search results do partially overlap.  Thus, the script removed duplicate URLs. This phase corresponds to the green boxes labelled "search FDsys" and "create source lists" in Figure \ref{fig:workflow-detail} on page \pageref{fig:workflow-detail}.  The /bash/ scripts are in [[app-search-url][Appendix A]].

*** COMP Download source documents & Convert to plain text	     :subsec:
#<<method-detailed-steps-B>>
In the previous step ([[method-detailed-steps-A][Subsection 3.5.1]]) I created lists of files that were selected by the search.  In this step I downloaded these files from FDsys, the federal government on-line database (http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/). I wrote /bash/ UNIX scripts that downloaded the data and placed these files in the appropriate directory, and then converted them into plain text files.  The scripts created a log file that could be inspected.  The scripts also provided the number of downloaded files in each directory. 

This step corresponds to boxes "download source files" and "convert to plain text" in work flow diagram \ref{fig:workflow-detail} on \pageref{fig:workflow-detail}.  These /bash/ scripts are shown in [[app-download][Appendix B]].

*** COMP Build tables of file descriptions			     :subsec:
#<<method-detailed-steps-C>>
In the previous step ([[method-detailed-steps-B][Subsection 3.5.2]]) I downloaded and converted into plain text files the data sources.  In this step I built the tables of file description of the downloaded data sources.  This step was necessary to start the analysis of the data sources. These tables were later loaded into the *QDA* application using /R/ scripts (see [[app-file-attr][Appendix F]]). 

The resulting tables are shown in [[finding-documents][Section 4.2]] and the /bash/ UNIX scripts that helped me in building these tables are shown in [[app-file-descr][Appendix C]].

The output was used to build the description of files in the tables for the Presidential Documents in [[findings-documents-pres-docs][Subsection 4.2.1]]. Also another table was produced, but it is too large to be displayed here.  This table was then exported as a "tab separated value" file and use to populate the file attributes table in the /RQDA/ project database for the Presidential documents.

The same steps were done for the Congressional Hearings. The output of another /bash/ script was used to build the description of files in the tables in [[findings-documents-congr-hearings][Subsection 4.2.2]].  Also another large table was produced. This table was then exported as a "tab separated value" file and use to populate the file attributes table in the /RQDA/ project database for the Congressional hearings (see [[method-detailed-steps-F][Subsection 3.5.6]]).

This step corresponds to the red box "import into RQDA" in work flow diagram \ref{fig:workflow-detail} on page \pageref{fig:workflow-detail} as explained in [[method-detailed-steps-F][Subsection 3.5.5]].  

*** COMP Text formatting & scrubbing 				     :subsec:
#<<method-detailed-steps-D>>
At this step of the investigation process I 'scrubbed' and formatted the text in the downloaded documents.  This step corresponds to the green box "extract statements" in the flow chart \ref{fig:workflow-detail} on page \pageref{fig:workflow-detail} and was performed by /bash/ UNIX scripts, one for each of the two document collections.

The downloaded texts did not have proper paragraphs.  Each line ended in a line break/return character.  Thus, I included in the /bash/ scripts the instructions to build paragraphs based on blank lines and indentations of the texts.  In other cases I had to manually build paragraphs using an /Emacs/ function.

In the case of the Congressional Hearings the documents often contained both written statements and the reading of it.  Even though these two renditions were not identical, they basically duplicate all the content of the statement.  Thus, I have chosen the written statement and deleted the reading of it.  Sometimes the written statement was missing or corrupted and I was thus forced to use the version that was read.

In addition the hearings have also the transcripts of discussions and 'chit-chat'. To reduce the text to only its 'high content' portions, I extract only the written statements and letters if they are not read out.  Then all the pieces were recombined into a 'scrubbed' file that could then be imported into the QDA software (see step [[method-detailed-steps-E][3.5.5]]).  I have excluded all discussions because they are much more intricate and complex and would require a different level of analysis.

The /bash/ UNIX scripts and a few more details are show in [[app-scrub][Appendix D]].

In this step I began the computer assisted qualitative data analysis.  The software used is the /R/ package /RQDA/.  See http://rqda.r-forge.r-project.org/.

Once the data sources were "scrubbed" they were ready to be imported into /RQDA/, the QDA software.  /RQDA/ organizes the data into 'projects', each project has as back-end a SQLite database file (see http://www.sqlite.org).  The text of each file is inserted into a database field 'file' of the table 'source'.  In addition each project has a description which is stored in the 'project' table.  During later steps several other tables in the databases will be populated.  Sometimes I could use scripts to enter data and sometimes I had to do this manually. This will be shown in the following subsections of this chapter.

I wrote a script for each of the two document collections, Presidential Documents and Congressional Hearings.  These scripts would (1) load the scrubbed plain text files and (2) insert a project description.  These /R/ scripts were based on code given to me by the developer of /RQDA/, Wincent Ronggui Huang (http://homepage.fudan.edu.cn/rghuang/cv/).  The /R/ scripts themselves are shown in [[app-imp-rqda][Appendix E]].  This appendix also shows the /R/ commands used to create and open the /RQDA/ projects and then run the /R/ scripts.

These /R/ scripts and command performed the operations corresponding to the red box "import into RQDA" of the work flow diagram (\ref{fig:workflow-detail}, page \pageref{fig:workflow-detail}).

*** COMP Apply attributes to files in /RQDA/			     :subsec:
#<<method-detailed-steps-F>>
In this subsection I describe the method for the *file* level analysis. I wrote collection specific /R/ scripts to first populate the "attributes" database table in the /RQDA/ project database. This database table contains the names and descriptions of the file attributes and is common to all /RQDA/ projects (see Table \ref{tbl:file-attributes-part}, page \pageref{tbl:file-attributes-part}). The table is exported as a tab separated values file, =attributes.tsv=. The /R/ script will read this file and populate the "attributes" table. then the script will load the actual attribute values for each of the files of this project into the "fileAttr" table that contains the file specific attributes. Some of the data was extracted from the specific =<collection>-url.lst= file that contains the URLs of the documents that were searched for in FDsys (see [[method-detailed-steps-A][Subsection 3.5.1]] and [[app-search-url][Appendix A]]). The missing information was the author, title, and date of the documents, which are very difficult to automatically extract from the text of the document files.  Thus, I manually created a table with that information.

The following table describes the file attributes used for all document collections

#+tblname: file-attributes-part
#+LABEL: tbl:file-attributes-part
#+CAPTION: File Attributes
| name        | description                                          |
|-------------+------------------------------------------------------|
| DocDate     | File: date of release of document                    |
| DocType     | File: type of document, i.e. collection              |
| DocId       | File: serial or identification number of document    |
| Title       | File: title of document                              |
| Author      | File: name of author, person or institution          |
| AuthorCat   | File: category of author, e.g. Senator, House        |
| Institution | File: name of institution that released the document |

Notice that all the descriptions begin with "File: ...". This is to distinguish them from case attributes that will be loaded later (see [[method-detailed-steps-G][3.5.7]]). This step of the investigation corresponds to the red box "apply attributes to files" of the work flow diagram \ref{fig:workflow-detail} on page \pageref{fig:workflow-detail} and the /R/ scripts are show in [[app-file-attr][Appendix F]].  The results of this process are shown in [[findings-documents][Section 4.2]].

*** COMP Define and describe statements in /RQDA/		     :subsec:
#<<method-detailed-steps-G>>
This is the 3rd level of analysis, the level of statement. Each of the documents contained one or more statements.  In the case of the Presidential Documents, each file corresponded to only one statement.  On the contrary, the Congressional Hearings were comprised of several statements.  I was only interested in statements with coded paragraphs (see [[method-detailed-steps-I][3.5.8]]). Thus, procedurally I had to code the texts before describing the statements.

/RQDA/ allowed me this level of analysis by using constructs that it calls "cases". The author of /RQDA/ implemented this feature to perform *Qualitative Comparative Analysis* (see http://www.u.arizona.edu/~cragin/fsQCA/index.shtml). *QCA* is an analytical technique that uses Boolean algebra.  It did not perform *QCA* but took advantage of these "cases" to assist me in the analysis of the statements. Simply, each statement with coded paragraphs was assigned to a case and each case was assigned attributes that described these statements.

How to do so is described in the on-line /RQDA/ manual, part 7 (http://rqda.r-forge.r-project.org/documentation_2.html#manual).

Each statement has a set of attributes, an author, an audience, and a date, that were assigned. The statement date, "CaseDate", is obviously the same as the date of the document. The author has an affiliation with a political party or a public or private institution, school, company or organization. In addition we can abstract a "message" of the author. Unlike the other attributes, this one is not unambiguous. I read the statement and would look for one or few sentence that would "jump out" to me.  I would pay special attention to the introduction or the conclusion of the statement and the coded parts of the text.  For these attributes see Table \ref{tbl:case-attributes} on page \pageref{tbl:case-attributes}.

#+tblname: case-attributes
#+LABEL: tbl:case-attributes
#+CAPTION: Statement (case) attributes
| Statement attribute | Attribute description                         |
|---------------------+-----------------------------------------------|
| CaseAuthor          | Author of the statement                       |
| CaseDate            | Date of the statement, same of the document   |
| AuthorAudience      | Audience of the statement                     |
| AuthorAffiliation   | Political party or organization of the author |
| AuthorMessage       | Message of the author                         |
|---------------------+-----------------------------------------------|

I have written scripts for each project that loads all the cases into the project database by populating the "caseAttr", "cases", and "caselinkage" tables.  The case attributes were loaded already with the file attributes previously (see [[method-detailed-steps-F][3.5.6]]).  The descriptions (memos) of all case attributes start with "Case: ...".   A complication exists for one Presidential Document because it consists of a presidential debate, thus there are two authors for these documents.

The only attribute that could be assigned automatically is the "CaseDate" because its value corresponds to the "DocDate" of the file where the statement was derived.

From this point on, the process was interactive where I read the statements and answered the questions (entering the values of the case attributes).  Operationally, in the /RQDA/ GUI I proceeded as follows (1) click on "cases" tab and open a case, (2) select a portion of text, (3) click on the "link" button, (4) right-click on the case and select "add/modify attributes" and enter the specific value of the case attribute.

This step of the investigation corresponds to the red box "apply attributes to statements" of the work flow diagram \ref{fig:workflow-detail} on page \pageref{fig:workflow-detail}. The scripts for this step are shown in [[app-case-attr][Appendix G]].  The results of the analysis of statements are shown in [[findings-statements][Section 4.3]].

*** COMP Summary results of statement analysis in /RQDA/	     :subsec:
#<<method-detailed-steps-H>>
In [[app-case-summary][Appendix H]] are /R/ scripts that I used to generate data that are shown in [[findings-statements][Section 4.3]]. This step corresponds to the red box labelled "tables, plots, diagrams" in Figure \ref{fig:workflow-detail} on page \pageref{fig:workflow-detail} in conjunction with [[method-detailed-steps-J][Subsection 3.5.9]].

*** COMP Apply QDA codes to paragraphs in /RQDA/		     :subsec:
#<<method-detailed-steps-I>>
This step was the "core" of the QDA process.  This process was quite complex and laborious. It required many components and processes, both scripted and manual.  The components were the definition and description of codes and code categories that were then stored in tables.  The processes were the loading of the codes and code categories into /RQDA/, the connection of codes to code categories, and the scripted and manual application of codes to the units of analysis, the paragraphs. I performed the classical hierarchical 2-level coding procedure of codes within categories of codes.

In QDA the interpretation and thoughts of the researcher are much more pre-eminent than in quantitative analysis, thus any automatic application of codes (auto-coding) was but a preliminary step that had to be followed by a careful reading of the texts where I confirmed applied codes (true positive) or removed them (false positive), or manually added them (false negative).

Based on the chosen discourse analysis theory, /governmentality/, I developed a set of /a priori/ codes and code categories that were applied to the unit of QDA analysis, the paragraph. I chose to perform /a priori/ coding instead of open coding because the theoretical framework already provided them, albeit indirectly.  The codes and code categories were "abstracted" by me from the literature and adapted to the specifics of this research project.

I followed the classical 2-level hierarchical coding structure of a set of code categories (also called themes or dimensions) and where each code category contains a set of a codes \cite[p. 153]{Creswell:2007a}.

The starting point of the process of creation of code categories were the definitions of /governmentality/ given by Michel Foucault himself \cite[pp. 108-109]{Foucault:2009a}.  Interestingly, Foucault did not give only one definition, but rather three (see here below).  We should recall that Foucault never published a book on governmentality and what we know about this concept is from a two series of lectures by him who were recorded and then transcribed and published in a book format (see [[lit-review-governmentality][Section 2.4]]).

To help me in this process of "abstraction" of themes and codes I created a flow chart (\ref{fig:govern-dimensions}, page \pageref{fig:govern-dimensions}) where I conceptually connected the components of Foucault's three definitions of /governmentality/.  For thoroughness I consulted both the original French and the translations of Foucault's definitions.  I have reproduced both here below the English version

#+LABEL: fig:govern-dimensions
#+CAPTION: Three dimensions of Governmentality
#+ATTR_LaTeX: placement=[htbp]
[[/home/henk/Dropbox/dissertation/graphic/govern-dimensions.jpg]]

#+begin_quote
1. The ensemble formed by the /institutions/, /procedures/, /analyses and reflections/, the /calculations and tactics/ that allow the exercise of this very specific albeit complex form of power, which has as its /target/ population, as its principal /form of knowledge/ political economy, and as its essential /technical means/ apparatuses of security.

2. The /tendency/ which, over a long period and throughout the west, has steadily led towards the pre-eminence over all other forms (sovereignty, discipline, etc) of this type of power which may be termed government, resulting, on the one hand, in /formation of a whole series of specific governmental apparatuses/, and, on the other, in the development of a whole /complex of savoirs/.

3. The process, or rather the /result of the process/, through which the state of justice of the middle ages, transformed into the /administrative state/ during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, gradually becomes 'governmentalized'.
#+end_quote

#+begin_latex
\noindent
#+end_latex
Here below are the original French definitions

#+begin_quote
1. Tout d’abord, l’ensemble constitué par les /institutions/, les /procédures/, les /analyses et les réflexions/, les /calculs et les tactiques qui permet d’exercer un pouvoir ayant pour cible principale la population, pour forme majeure de savoir l’économie politique (cf. le mercantilisme) et pour instrument technique essentiel les dispositifs de sécurité (la «police»). 

2. Ensuite, la tendance qui dans tout l’occident conduit vers la prééminence d’un type de pouvoir particulier parmi d’autres : le gouvernement (les autres étant : la souveraineté, la discipline, etc.). 

3. Enfin, le processus ou plutôt le résultat du processus par lequel l’état de justice du moyen age, qui est devenu vers 1500, un état administratif, devient progressivement gouvernementalisé, c’est-à-dire s’est vu adjoindre de plus en plus de prérogatives sur la population \cite{Foucault:2004a}.
#+end_quote

The next step was to connect logically these three definitions among themselves and with other concepts and thus produced Figure \ref{fig:governmentality} on page \pageref{fig:governmentality}.

#+LABEL: fig:governmentality
#+CAPTION: Conceptualization of Governmentality
#+ATTR_LaTeX: placement=[h!]

In addition I composed a Table (\ref{tbl:dimensions}, page \pageref{tbl:dimensions}) where again I try to systematize the concepts of governmentality.

|-----------------------------------------------------------------+------------|

I developed a glossary of the terms used in Foucault's Theory of Governmentality that guided and assisted me in assigning codes and codes into code categories.  Some were verbatim statements from online resources and others were rewritten by me.  This is necessary because Foucault never published a book on this theory, but only have the transcriptions of two above mentioned two series of lectures, one in 1978 "Sécurité, Territoire, Population" \cite{Foucault:2004a} and one in 1979 "Naissance de la biopolitique" \cite{Foucault:2004b}.  In indication of the 'rough' status of this theory is the fact as we have seen that there are three definitions of the term 'governmentality'.
#+begin_latex
\smallskip
#+end_latex

#+begin_latex
\noindent
#+end_latex
*A. Practices of government*

#+begin_latex
\noindent
#+end_latex
Practices of government are deliberate attempts to shape conduct in certain ways in relation to certain objectives. attempts at governing may be formally rationalized in programmatic statements, policy documents, pamphlets and speeches (Rose, 1999).
#+begin_latex
\smallskip
#+end_latex

#+begin_latex
\noindent
#+end_latex
*B. Governmentality*

#+begin_latex
\noindent
#+end_latex
Process through which a form of government with specific ends (a happy and stable society), means to these ends ("apparatuses of security"), and with a particular type of knowledge ("political economy"), to achieve these ends, evolved from a medieval state of justice to a modern administrative state with complex bureaucracies. (Burchell, 1991, p. 102)

To analyse government is to analyse those mechanisms that try to shape, sculpt, mobilise and work through the choices, desires, aspirations, needs, wants and lifestyles of individuals and groups (Dean, 1999:12).
#+begin_latex
\smallskip
\noindent
#+end_latex

#+begin_latex
\noindent
#+end_latex
*C. Knowledge = savoir*

#+begin_latex
\noindent
#+end_latex
Foucault encourages us to think of power not only in terms of hierarchical, top-down power of the state. he widens our understanding of power to also include the forms of social control in disciplinary institutions (schools, hospitals, psychiatric institutions, etc.), as well as the forms of knowledge. power can manifest itself positively by producing knowledge and certain discourses that get internalised by individuals and guide the behaviour of populations. this leads to more efficient forms of social control, as knowledge enables individuals to govern themselves.
#+begin_latex
\smallskip
#+end_latex

#+begin_latex
\noindent
#+end_latex
*D. Neo-liberal governmentality*

#+begin_latex
\noindent
#+end_latex
A particular form of governmentality is characterized by a certain form of knowledge ("savoir" in French). In the case of neoliberal governmentality (a kind of governmentality based on the predominance of market mechanisms and of the restriction of the action of the state) the knowledge produced allows the construction of auto-regulated or auto-correcting selves.

Thus neo-liberalism must work to create the social reality that it proposes already exists. for as Lemke states, a mentality of government "is not pure, neutral knowledge that simply re-presents the governing reality" (Lemke, 2001:191) instead, neo-liberalism constitutes an attempt to link a reduction in state welfare services and security systems to the increasing call for subjects to become free, enterprising, autonomous individuals. it can then begin to govern its subjects, not through intrusive state bureaucracies backed with legal powers, the imposition of moral standards under a religious mandate, but through structuring the possible field of action in which they govern themselves, to govern them through their freedom. through the transformation of subjects with duties and obligations, into individuals, with rights and freedoms, modern individuals are not merely 'free to choose' but obliged to be free, "to understand and enact their lives in terms of choice" (Rose, 1999:87). this freedom is a different freedom to that offered in the past. it is a freedom to realize our potential and our dreams through reshaping the way in which we conduct our lives.

#+end_latex

#+begin_latex
\noindent
#+end_latex
*E. Apparatuses (dispositif)*

#+begin_latex
\noindent
#+end_latex
Foucault generally uses this term to indicate the various institutional, physical and administrative mechanisms and knowledge structures, which enhance and maintain the exercise of power within the social body. The original French term 'dispositif' is rendered variously as 'dispositif', 'apparatus' and 'deployment' in English translations of Foucault's work.

#+end_latex

#+begin_latex
\noindent
#+end_latex
*G. Crises of governmentality*

#+begin_latex
\noindent
#+end_latex
A period of crisis, where the logic of ensuring freedom (which was defined against the background of risk or danger) necessitates actions "which potentially risk producing exactly the opposite."
#+begin_latex
\smallskip
#+end_latex

#+begin_latex
\noindent
#+end_latex
*H. Technology, technique, techne*
Foucault defines the Greek word 'techne' as 'a practical rationality governed by a conscious aim'. Foucault generally prefers the word 'technology', which he uses to encompass the broader meanings of techne. Foucault often uses the words techniques and technologies interchangeably, although sometimes techniques tend to be specific and localized and technologies more general collections of specific techniques.

Four major types of these "technologies," each a matrix of practical reason: (i) technologies of production, which permit us to produce, transform, or manipulate things; (2) technologies of sign systems, which permit us to use signs, meanings, symbols, or signification; (3) technologies of power, which determine the conduct of individuals and submit them to certain ends or domination, an objectivizing of the subject; (4) technologies of the self, which permit individuals to effect by their own means or with the help of others a certain number of operations on their own bodies and souls, thoughts, conduct, and way of being, so as to transform themselves in order to attain a certain state of happiness, purity, wisdom, perfection, or immortality. (http://foucault.info/documents/foucault.technologiesofself.en.html)
#+begin_latex

#+begin_latex

#+end_latex
*I. Technologies of power*

#+begin_latex
\noindent
#+end_latex
Technologies imbued with aspirations for the shaping of conduct in the hope of producing certain desired effects and averting certain undesired ones" [Rose, 1999:52]. the two main groups of technologies of power are *technologies of the self*, and *technologies of the market*. Foucault defined technologies of the self as techniques that allow individuals to effect by their own means a certain number of operations on their own bodies, minds, souls, and lifestyle, so as to transform themselves in order to attain a certain state of happiness, and quality of life. technologies of the market are those technologies based around the buying and selling of goods that enable us to define who we are, or want to be. these two technologies are not always completely distinct, as both borrow bits of each other from time to time.
#+begin_latex
\smallskip
#+end_latex

#+begin_latex
\noindent
#+end_latex
*J. Technology of power - normalization*

#+begin_latex
\noindent
#+end_latex
Another technology of power arising from the social sciences is that of normalisation. The technology of norms was given a push by the new methods of measuring population. a norm is that "which is socially worthy, statistically average, scientifically healthy and personally desirable". The important aspect of normality, is that while the norm is natural, those who wish to achieve normality will do so by working on themselves, controlling their impulses in everyday conduct and habits, and inculcating norms of conduct into their children, under the guidance of others. Norms are enforced through the calculated administration of shame. Shame entails an anxiety over the exterior behaviour and appearance of the self, linked to an injunction to care for oneself in the name of achieving quality of life (Rose, 1999:73). Norms are usually aligned with political goals, thus the norm would be fit, virile, energetic individuals, able to work, earn money, and spend it and thus sustain the economy. for instance, the practice of going to the gym allows one to achieve this ‘normality’. Through shame we are governed into conforming with the goals of neo-liberalism.
#+begin_latex

#+end_latex

#+begin_latex

#+end_latex
*K. Technology of identity through consumption*

#+begin_latex
\noindent
#+end_latex
The technology of identity through consumption utilises the power of goods to shape identities.
#+begin_latex
\smallskip
#+end_latex

#+begin_latex
\noindent
#+end_latex
*L. Technologies of the self*

#+begin_latex
\noindent
#+end_latex
Practices and strategies by which individuals represent to themselves their own ethical self-understanding. One of the main features of technologies of self is that of expertise. expertise has three important aspects. First, its grounding of authority in a claim to scientificity and objectivity creates distance between self-regulation and the state that is necessary with liberal democracies. Second, expertise can "mobilise and be mobilised within political argument in distinctive ways, producing a new relationship between knowledge and government. expertise comes to be accorded a particular role in the formulation of programs of government and in the technologies that seek to give them effect" (Rose, 1996:156). Third, expertise operates through a relationship with the self-regulating abilities of individuals. the plausibility inherent in a claim to scientificity binds "subjectivity to truth and subjects to experts" (Rose, 1996:156). Expertise works through a logic of choice, through a transformation of the ways in which individuals constitute themselves, through "inculcating desires for self-development that expertise itself can guide and through claims to be able to allay the anxieties generated when the actuality of life fails to live 
up to its image (Rose, 1999:88).
#+begin_latex
\smallskip
#+end_latex

#+begin_latex
\noindent
#+end_latex
*M. Technology of responsibilisation*

#+begin_latex
\noindent
#+end_latex
This entails subjects becoming responsibilised by making them see social risks such as illness, unemployment, poverty, etc. Not as the responsibility of the state, but actually lying in the domain for which the individual is responsible and transforming it into a problem of 'self-care' (Lemke, 2001:201). the practice of going to the gym can be seen as a result of responsibilisation, our responsibility to remain free of illness so as to be able to work and to care for our dependants (children, elderly parents etc.) This technology somewhat overlaps with the technology of healthism.
#+begin_latex
\smallskip
#+end_latex

#+begin_latex
\noindent
#+end_latex
*N. Regime of truth*

#+begin_latex
\noindent
#+end_latex
Foucault defines 'regimes of truth' as the historically specific mechanisms which produce discourses which function as true in particular times and places.
#+begin_latex
\smallskip
#+end_latex

#+begin_latex
\noindent
#+end_latex
*O. Political economy*

#+begin_latex
\noindent
#+end_latex
Economy at the level of the entire state, which means exercising towards its inhabitants, and the wealth and behavior of each and all, a form of surveillance and control as attentive as that of the head of a family over his household and his goods" (Burchell, 1991, p. 92)
#+begin_latex
\smallskip
#+end_latex

At point I could create my code categories and I listed them in Table \ref{tbl:themes} on page \pageref{tbl:themes}. This classification of themes is based on my personal 'distillation' of Foucault's treatment of /governmentality/ and that of his successors (e.g. Dean, Burchell, and Rose). /GovGoal/ stands for "goals of governmentality", /GovKnowledge/ for "knowledge of governmentality", /GovMeans/ for "means of governmentality", and /AdminTendency/ for "historical tendency, outcome of historical process" leading to the 'administrative state'.  These categories are common for both document collections.

Following this was the creation of the codes and their assignment to code categories.  The result of this process is shown in a series of figures.  In Figure \ref{fig:nation-goal} on page \pageref{fig:nation-goal} is the diagram for the code category /NationGoal/, in Figure \ref{fig:rationality} on page \pageref{fig:rationality} is the diagram for code category /Rationality/, in Figure \ref{fig:tech-power} on page \pageref{fig:tech-power} is the diagram for code category /TechPower/, and in Figure \ref{fig:tech-self} on page \pageref{fig:tech-self} is the diagram for code category /TechSelf/.

The development of the codes were an interactive process where I combined the analysis of the theory with the appraisal of the content of the data sources. At the end of the process I ended up not needing the fifth code category. I obtained 39 codes that are listed in Table \ref{tbl:qda-codes} on page \pageref{tbl:qda-codes}.

A description of these codes is given in Table \ref{tbl:code-descr} on page \pageref{tbl:code-descr}. The application of codes to paragraphs is accomplished in two steps each actuated by an /R/ script.  The first one loads the names and descriptions of the codes from Tables \ref{tbl:qda-codes} (page \pageref{tbl:qda-codes}) and \ref{tbl:code-descr} (page \pageref{tbl:code-descr}) into the "freecode" database table of the /rqda/ project. These codes are in common among all collections. the codes were obtained /inductively/ from a pilot study of the documents in conjunction with a /deductive/ process based on the theory of governmentality.  The QDA codes are shown in tables \ref{tbl:qda-codes} (page \pageref{tbl:qda-codes}) and \ref{tbl:code-descr} (page \pageref{tbl:code-descr}).

The second step is the application of these codes to the paragraphs in the files of the document collections based the content of the text unit, the paragraph. This is two-step process accomplished by an /R/ script that populates the "coding" database table in the /RQDA/ project with "tentative" codes based on "text patterns", followed up by a careful reading of the texts that 'fine-tunes' the code application process.

These two tasks correspond to the boxes "apply codes to paragraphs" of the work flow diagram (Figure \ref{fig:workflow-detail}, page \pageref{fig:workflow-detail}).

|----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

The ideal situation is non-overlapping (orthogonal) word patterns. that is, each word pattern should correspond to only one code.  However, sometimes this is impossible. For instance the pattern "fire bad teacher" is common to both codes /TeacherQuality/ and /TeacherReplace/, "A Nation at Risk" is a pattern for both codes /NationInterest/ and /EducGap/, "AYP" and "adequate yearly progress" are a pattern for both codes /SchoolQuality/ and /StudentAssess/, "parental choice" is a pattern for both codes /ParentInvolve/ and /SchoolChoice/, "highly qualified teacher requirement" is a pattern for both codes /EducEquity/ and /TeacherQuality/.

To help me in the coding process I wrote several /R/ scripts.  One of these scripts would load the codes and the themes and their definitions into the project database based on the above tables.  In addition I wrote /R/ scripts that would apply a tentative code to a line of text based on the presence in the line of one or more key words.  For details see [[app-qda-codes][Appendix I]].

In each of the document collection sections is an /R/ script. Initially, the script populates the "freecode" table in the appropriate /RQDA/ project database.  The codes will be read from a tab separated value file, =codes.tsv=. Then the /R/ script will load the code categories (also called themes) into the "codecat" table. After that it will assign codes to the categories by populating the "treecode" table. Finally, the script will assign tentative codes to paragraphs in the documents based on key words according in table \ref{tbl:code-patterns} in [[app-qda-codes][Appendix I]] (page \pageref{tbl:code-patterns}).  The table of patterns was to large to be included here.

Many paragraphs will be auto-coded.  However, by reading through the document I only kept the codes on paragraphs coded with /EducGap/ and related paragraphs.  Sometimes I added /EducGap/ when it is not auto-coded, but the meaning of the text demands it. If the label /EducGap/ is added because of a simple mention of "dissaggredated" then the code is not kept.  Differential drop-out is manually coded for /EducGap/, as are comparisons of graduation rates with other countries.

In the /RQDA/ GUI click on the "files" tab and open and read each file.  Then confirm or remove the code.  other coded can be added.  Also the boundaries of the coding areas can be changed by first removing the coding and then adding it. The automatic coding will by necessity generate many 'false positives'.  For example, just the term 'achievement' will also label many paragraphs that have nothing to do with school or academic achievement.  I removed all codes applied to post-secondary education and early childhood education that have no reference to K-12 education. In addition I removed codings in section titles and references. These code removals and changes will create inactive records in the database table "coding". These inactive records can be removed by running the CleanProject() command or through the /RQDA/ GUI.

The scripts that I used for the coding process are shown in [[app-qda-codes][Appendix I]]. This step corresponds to the brown box labelled "create codes & themes" and the red box labelled "apply codes to paragraphs" in the work flow diagram \ref{fig:workflow-detail} on page \pageref{fig:workflow-detail}.  The results of the analysis of the codings in presented in  [[findings-paragraphs][Section 4.4]].

*** COMP Summary results of QDA codes in /RQDA/ 		     :subsec:
#<<method-detailed-steps-J>>
After applying the *QDA* codes to the relevant paragraphs, as described in [[method-detailed-steps-I][Subsection 3.5.8]] and [[app-qda-codes][Appendix I]], I could obtain some descriptive statistics of the codings. These descriptive statistics are the (1) number of codings for each code, (2) average number of words, (3) files associated with each code, and (4) the relationship between the codes.

The relation between two codes is defined as number of paragraphs that are marked with both codes.  The detection of code relations helped the development of the *QDA* narratives. Thus, to explore the relationships between the codes I assume that when the same paragraph is coded by more than one code, those codes are related.  These relations are given by /RQDA/ as a upper triangular weighted adjacency matrix (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix and ftp://ftp.ccu.edu.tw/pub/languages/CRAN/web/packages/RQDA/RQDA.pdf).  It is *weighted* because some codes will be more highly correlated than others and numerically this corresponds to the count of paragraphs where both codes are applied.

There are 39 codes belonging to 4 code categories.  The graphical representation of so many codes is confusing.  Thus it is best to refer to tabulations for descriptive statistics on the codes.categories and case attributes.

The plots were created using the /ggplot2/ package (http://http://had.co.nz/ggplot2).

This step corresponds to the red box "tables, plots, diagrams" in Figure \ref{fig:workflow-detail} on page \pageref{fig:workflow-detail}. Red boxes in this figure correspond to *QDA* analysis steps and blue boxes to text mining.  The corresponding /R/ scripts are in [[app-codes-summary][Appendix J]].

*** COMP Create /tm/ corpora from /RQDA/			     :subsec:
#<<method-detailed-steps-K>>
During this step the text of the coded paragraphs (codings) were converted into a text "corpus".  The corpus was then subjected to text processing and analysis (text mining) as described in the following two subsections.  I decided to create a corpus of only the coded paragraphs to avoid the inclusion of non-relevant material into the analysis.  This way the statistical results and representations better reflected the political discourse specific to the research question.

The software used to perform text mining is the /tm/ package of /R/.  See http://tm.r-forge.r-project.org/.  The /R/ code for this step was adapted from code of the /RQDAtm/ package (see http://rqda.r-forge.r-project.org/).

This step corresponds to the box "import codings into tm" of the workflow chart (\ref{fig:workflow-detail}, page \pageref{fig:workflow-detail}).  The /R/ scripts that create these /tm/ corpora are shown in [[app-rqda2tm][Appendix K]]. These scripts will export from the /RQDA/ database the paragraphs that were coded from the 'coding' table.  Then a /tm/ function was used to create a text mining corpus, which the was saved to a file to be uploaded to =brazos.tamu.edu=, the high performance cluster of at Texas A&M University (see http://brazos.tamu.edu) for processing (see [[method-detailed-steps-L][3.5.12]]).

*** COMP Process /tm/ corpora					     :subsec:
#<<method-detailed-steps-L>>
After the creation of the /corpus/ the text needs to be processed before the actual text mining can take place. The processing consists of the conversion to lower case, the removal of low-content words, the conversion of relevant synonyms onto a single term, the removal of numbers, the removal of white space, and the removal of punctuation.  An additional step in the processing is the stemming of the words, which is the removal of suffixes from related words to convert all of them into a single 'root' term.  

This stage of the research sequence corresponds to the step "process text" of Figure \ref{fig:workflow-detail} on page \pageref{fig:workflow-detail}.  The processing will create two /corpora/ for each document collection. The first one without stemming (unstemmed) and the second one with stemming.  I needed the unstemmed corpus for some descriptive statistics such as a "word cloud", and the stemmed corpus for strict text mining statistics.

All these text modifications are performed by /R/ scripts that utilize the /tm/ package and are shown in  [[app-process][Appendix L]].

The list of "stopwords" was obtained recursively from the text mining step proper.  I checked which words were most frequent in the document-term matrix and, if not relevant, I added them to the stop word list and reran the text processing step.  The stop words consist of names of persons (e.g. "mary", "yvonne", "diane") and names of months, but not names of universities such as "john hopkins", or scholarships such as "noyce" or juridic terms such as "brown", or names of members of congress, or names of cities.  Notice that the names are specified in lowercase because this step of elimination occurred after the conversion to lowercase as can be seen in the script. In addition I removed numbers expressed in Roman numerals, because the /tm/ function used to remove numbers is only able to remove Arabic numbers.

The processing of texts was computationally very intensive.  Thus, it was performed on =brazos.tamu.edu=, the Texas A&M high performance computer cluster.  For details see http://brazos.tamu.edu and [[app-brazos][Appendix N]].  For more details on the processing of corpora see \citeA{Feinerer:2008a,Feinerer:2008b,Feinerer:2008c}.

*** COMP Text mine /tm/ corpora 				     :subsec:
  :PROPERTIES:
  :table_export_file: ~/Dropbox/dissertation/data/dictionary.tsv
  :table_export_format: orgtbl-to-tsv
  :END:
#<<method-detailed-steps-M>>
# M-x org-table-export

During this stage the actual text mining occurred.  The /corpora/ that were created and 
processed during the previous stages were converted into a =document-term= matrix. This is a matrix where the rows correspond to the documents and the columns to the terms. Statistical analyses are performed on these matrices.  These processes correspond to the step "text mining" in Figure \ref{fig:workflow-detail} on page \pageref{fig:workflow-detail}.

I created a text mining 'dictionary' for each document collection that contained terms of interest based on the research question and the results of the reading of the sources that preceded the statistical analysis (see Table \ref{tbl:dictionary}, page \pageref{tbl:dictionary}). Notice that the words in the table are "stemmed" as well as "unstemmed" to match the outcome of the stemming that was done during the processing of the documents. the columns "congr-hearings corr-limit" and "pres-docs-corr-limit" are used as a cut-off value when association between terms are calculated.  The lower the correlation limit, the higher the number of associated terms that are returned by /tm/.  The correlation limit was set at a level that yielded about 10 to 20 correlated terms.  Each correlated term will have a value associated to it that represents the statistical correlation, i.e. Pearson's /r/.  Cluster dendrograms were built using Ward's method \cite<see>{Everitt:2001a}.

See [[findings-words-intro][Subsection 4.5.1]] for a discussion and presentation of these results.

* STRT Findings 							:chp:
#<<findings>>

# One of the things to work out in the Results chapter is to select the
# detailed tables that should be in the body or in the Appendix. There is so
# much data that it is easy to get lost in what is there and why. Right now,
# it seems there are just a lot of somewhat disconnected data, tables,
# figures. That's why it's important to put these in a context and summarize
# what they are saying Also, as you write the Findings, be sure to make a
# clear connection of which data address which research questions. In
# "traditional" dissertations, I often recommend (re)stating each research
# question in turn, followed by the data/analyses that support it. Not sure if
# this applies directly, but the idea does.

The purpose of this chapter is to present at a certain level of detail the source texts that are used for the discourse analysis.  The discussion of these texts is reserved for the next chapter ([[discussion][Chapter 5]]).  More details about the source documents are provided in appendices [[app-data-pres-docs][P]] and [[app-data-congr-hearings][Q]].

As described in [[method][Chapter 3]], I chose one type of official document for the executive branch and one type for the legislative branch of the federal government for this investigation.  For the executive I obtained the Presidential Documents and for the legislative the Congressional Hearings.  These documents are my research data and they consist of transcribed public speeches and prepared statements that were the source of public speeches.

These speeches and statements can be analyzed at different levels of detail as is shown in Table \ref{tbl:level-analysis}. The first number refers to the Presidential Documents and the second to the Congressional Hearings. The highest level is the level of document collection.  Below that is the level of document.  The two collections are composed of a set of documents and each of them has a date, title, identification code, and so on (see [[method-detailed-steps-F][Subsection 3.5.6]]).  The next lower level is the statement.  Each statement has an author, a message, and an audience (see [[method-detailed-steps-G][Subsection 3.5.7]]).  Below that are the paragraphs that were coded according to content (see [[method-detailed-steps-I][Subsection 3.5.9]]).  At the lowest level were the words of a text themselves.  Content-rich words of the coded paragraphs were analyzed using text mining (see [[method-detailed-steps-M][Subsection 3.5.13]]).

More precisely, in Table \ref{tbl:level-analysis} the number of files refers to the unique documents loaded into /RQDA/, the number of statements pertain to statements where at least one paragraph was coded, the number of paragraphs refers to the paragraphs that were coded, and the number of words were the words in the each of the two /corpora/ after text processing.

** COMP The searched document collections and their documents 		:sec:
#<<findings-documents>>
In this section I present the results of the FDsys, the federal on-line database, searches and that were loaded into the *QDA* software project.  Each document has a reference code, a date, and a title.  [[app-file-descr][Appendix C]] provides more detailed information on the documents and on how I queried the *QDA* database to extract this information. In the following tables I show the content of the database fields: "Document ID", "Title" and "Document date".

*** COMP The Presidential Documents				     :subsec:
#<<findings-documents-pres-docs>>

In this section I provide a summary description of the 127 presidential documents returned by FDsys search.  The database search provided the results for three presidents, William Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. Note that the file IDs are of two types, one starting with "DCPD" and one starting with "WCPD".  The second type of ID contains the date of publication which is usually just a few days after the date of the speeches themselves and is displayed in the third column of tables.  The first type of ID contains only the year of publication.  For details refer to [[app-file-descr-pres-docs][Appendix C.1]].

Table \ref{tbl:docs-obama} on page \pageref{tbl:docs-obama} shows the speeches by President Barack Obama.

#<<findings-documents-congr-hearings>>
In this section I provide a summary description of the 87 Congressional Hearing documents returned by the FDsys search and loaded into the *QDA* application.  Long titles were shortened and the missing parts are indicated by dots.  The database search provided the results for hearings held by certain committees of the Senate, by some committees of the House of Representatives, and by a joint Senate-House committee.  [[app-file-descr-congr-hearings][Appendix C.2]] provides details on these documents.

Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-senate} on page \pageref{tbl:congr-hearings-senate} provides a list of the congressional hearings held by a Senate committee in chronological order.  The file ID starts with the session number, then the letters "shrg" for Senate Hearing, and ends with the hearing ID.

The following is a description of the only joint Senate-House committee hearing that was returned by the search

** COMP The coded statements						:sec:
#<<findings-statements>>
*** STRT Introduction						     :subsec:
#<<findings-statements-intro>>
In this section I present the results of the categorization of the coded statements and the description of their texts.  By "coded statements" I mean statements that had at least one coded paragraph in them.  For a description of how the statements were identified and categorized see [[method-detailed-steps-G][Subsection 3.5.7]].

There are five descriptors for the statements as can be seen in Table \ref{tbl:case-attributes}.

#+tblname: case-attributes
#+LABEL: tbl:case-attributes
#+CAPTION: Statement attributes
#+ATTR_LaTeX: placement=[htbp]
| Statement attribute | Attribute description                         |
|---------------------+-----------------------------------------------|
| Author              | Author of the statement                       |
| Date                | Date of the statement, same as document date  |
| Audience            | Audience of the statement                     |
| Affiliation         | Political party or organization of the author |
| Message             | Message of the author                         |
|---------------------+-----------------------------------------------|
*** COMP Presidential Documents 				     :subsec:
#<<findings-statements-pres-docs>>
Here I show the description of the statements of the Presidential documents. As we have seen previously, except for one document, which is a presidential election debate, all have a single statement.

To have an idea of the type of results of the FDsys search we can note the number of relevant statements per president (see Table \ref{tbl:case-authors}, page \pageref{tbl:case-authors}).  As we can see, the vast majority of the statements are by President Bush (the son).  The documents returned by the FDsys search span a time from the end of the second Clinton term, both terms of George Bush, and the beginning of the first term of President Barack Obama. 

#+tblname: case-authors
#+LABEL: tbl:case-authors
#+CAPTION: Number of Statements by Authors
#+ATTR_LaTeX: placement=[htbp]
| Author          | Number |
|-----------------+--------|
| William Clinton |      2 |
| George W. Bush  |    119 |
| John Kerry      |      2 |
| Barack Obama    |      8 |
|-----------------+--------|
| Total           |    131 |
|-----------------+--------|

I show in [[app-messages-pres-docs][Appendix P.1]] the messages for each of the statements and for each author in tables \ref{tbl:pres-docs-messages-obama} (page \pageref{tbl:pres-docs-messages-obama}), \ref{tbl:pres-docs-messages-clinton} (page \pageref{tbl:pres-docs-messages-clinton}), \ref{tbl:pres-docs-messages-bush} (page \pageref{tbl:pres-docs-messages-bush}), and \ref{tbl:pres-docs-messages-kerry} (page \pageref{tbl:pres-docs-messages-kerry}).

Note: (1) when the values are between double quotes they are verbatim from the statement, otherwise I have tried to abstract the message from the statement in my own words; (2) sometimes there is more than one message in a statement; and (3) some messages appear in more than one statement. An example is the exhortation by George W. Bush to be re-elected to the presidency.

*** STRT Congressional Hearings					     :subsec:
#<<findings-statements-congr-hearings>>
Each congressional hearing is comprised of several statements.  As we have seen in [[findings-documents-congr-hearings][Subsection 4.2.2]], the hearings can be classified by /audience/, which is the committee that organized the hearing.  They can also be summarized by /author/. Note that the House Committee on Education and the Workforce was named House Committee on Education and Labor from 2007 an 2011 when the Democratic Party controlled the House. The House Committee on Science and Technology was named "Committee on Science" between 1997 and 2007 when the Republican Party was in majority. Previously in was called the "Committee on Science, Space, and Technology".  In [[app-case-summary][Appendix H]] I show the /R/ code used to obtain the data in this section.

There were a total of *458* statements given to *12* different congressional committees (see Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-audience}, page \pageref{tbl:congr-hearings-audience}) by *297* different authors (see tables \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-senator} on page \pageref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-senator}, \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-representative} on page \pageref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-representative}, \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-gao} on page \pageref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-gao}, \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-executive} on page \pageref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-executive},  \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-local} on page \pageref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-local}, \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-business} on page \pageref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-business}, \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-univ} on page \pageref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-univ}, and \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-orgs} on page \pageref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-orgs}).

Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-audience} on page \pageref{tbl:congr-hearings-audience} summarizes the statements by committee.

The authors can be classified into four groups, (1) members of Congress, (2) witnesses, (3) organizations, and (4) the committees or subcommittees themselves.  Usually a document would contain a beginning statement prepared by the organizing committee or subcommittee, then statements by members of congress who may or may not belong to the (sub)committee, and then witnesses who can belong to executive branch departments or to universities, think tanks, professional organization, or socio-political organizations.  Sometimes the statements would not have a physical author and only have the name of the organization. Note that the same author can give more than one presentation during the same hearing.  Often a witness would give a statement and later answer questions.  A few statements were written and given by more than one author.

Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-senator} on page \pageref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-senator} lists the statements by U.S. senators.

To obtain an idea of the content of the selected documents I have prepared a series of tables that contain the messages of their statements (see [[method-detailed-steps-G][Subsection 3.5.7]]).  I placed those tables in [[app-messages-congr-hearings][Appendix P.2]].

** COMP The coded paragraphs						:sec:
#<<findings-paragraphs>>
*** STRT Introduction						     :subsec:
#<<findings-paragraphs-intro>>
In this section I present the descriptive statistics for the *QDA* codes that were applied to relevant paragraphs in the policy documents.  For details on the criteria and procedures for the application of these codes see [[method-detailed-steps-I][Subsection 3.5.9]] and for the code identification numbers refer to Table \ref{tbl:qda-codes} on page \pageref{tbl:qda-codes}.

There are basically two categories of statistical information about the codes that /RQDA/ provides.  They are about (1) each code individually, and (2) the relationships between the different codes.  In addition these two types of information can be presented in aggregated form in tables or chronologically as time plots.  Table \ref{tbl:summary-codings} presents the total number of coded applied to the paragraphs and the number of coded paragraphs (see also Table \ref{tbl:level-analysis}).  These numbers are different because the same paragraphs can have more than one code applied to it.

#+tblname: summary-codings

#+CAPTIONS: Summary of codings

| Collection       | Presidential | Congressional |
|------------------+--------------+---------------|
| Number files     |          127 |            87 |
| Total codings    |        4,779 |        18,513 |
| Coded paragraphs |        1,252 |         5,353 |
|------------------+--------------+---------------|

If we aggregate the single code codings we obtain two useful statistics, the number and relative frequency of codings per code and the number and relative frequency of files per code.  The data are arranged in decreasing order in the tables shown here below.

The relationship between codes is a more interesting statistical analysis of the codings.  However, it is very difficult to represent it graphically in a meaningful or clear fashion.  Thus, I present these code relationships in a tabular fashion as "cross-codes" tables.  Rows and columns refer to the *QDA* codes and at their intersection is the number of "overlaps", the times that the two codes in question are applied to the same paragraph.  For space reasons the columns only have the code IDs and the rows have both names and IDs.  The cross-codes tables are so wide that they are divided into two or three portions.

I created a charts for each *QDA* code where the coding data are represented as scatter time plots where each dot represents the times that a code is applied to the paragraphs of a document.  In addition to the points of the scatter plot is a trend line to give an idea of the change over time of the number of times that a code appears in a document.  I also prepared time plots that display more than one *QDA* code for comparison purposes.  These plots are shown in [[discussion][Chapter 5]] where they are relevant to the discussion.

The numbers, tables and graphs were obtained using the statistical analysis presented in [[app-codes-summary][Appendix Section J]].

The following two sections show the summary statistics for the codes in the two document collections.

*** STRT Presidential Documents					     :subsec:
#<<findings-paragraphs-pres-docs>>
Here I present figures that show descriptive statistics for the codes that were applied to the paragraphs of the Presidential Documents collection.

** COMP The content-rich words						:sec:
#<<findings-words>>
*** STRT Introduction						     :subsec:
#<<findings-words-intro>>
This analysis operates at the lowest level of aggregation, the words themselves.  I performed text mining of the high content words contained in the coded paragraphs (see sections [[method-detailed-steps-K][3.5.10]], [[method-detailed-steps-L][3.5.11]], and [[method-detailed-steps-M][3.5.12]]).

To structure the text mining analysis I created a 'dictionary' common to both document collections that contains terms of interest based on the research question and context (see Table \ref{tbl:dictionary} on page \pageref{tbl:dictionary} and [[method-detailed-steps-M][Subsection 3.5.13]]).

To obtain a general idea of the content of the document collection it may be useful to examine its word cloud. This is a visual representation of the most abundant words in a text or collection of texts (see figures \ref{fig:pres-docs-cloud}, page \pageref{fig:pres-docs-cloud} and \ref{fig:congr-hearings-cloud}, page \pageref{fig:congr-hearings-cloud}).  The size of a word is proportional to its abundance.  The color is assigned randomly in this type of word cloud and 15% of the words are displayed vertically.  The words that comprise the word cloud are taken from the unstemmed corpus.

A more quantitative representation of the word frequency are given in tables \ref{tbl:pres-docs-freq-terms} on page \pageref{tbl:pres-docs-freq-terms} and \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-freq-terms} on page \pageref{tbl:congr-hearings-freq-terms} where the 50 most common words from the stemmed and the unstemmed text mining /corpora/ are given.  Notice that "twentyfirst" was obtained by transformation from the words "twenty-first".

Then I present a table for each of the terms in Table \ref{tbl:dictionary} (page \pageref{tbl:dictionary}) the terms that are most closely associated with them. The first term in the table is the word itself followed by the other terms most closely associated with it.  The number below the terms are a mathematical expression of the closeness to the first term.  The terms are arranged in decreasing degree of closeness.  The lowest closeness is close to the cut-off level of Table \ref{tbl:dictionary}).

In this section I also I present a type of graph called 'dendrogram'.  This kind of graph represents the closeness of terms in a text by a process of hierarchical clustering.  Among the several types of hierarchical clustering I have chosen 'Ward's minimum variance method'.

The first dendrogram, figures \ref{fig:pres-docs-freq} on page \pageref{fig:pres-docs-freq} and \ref{fig:congr-hearings-freq} on page \pageref{fig:congr-hearings-freq} represent the clustering of the most frequent terms in the document collection (see tables \ref{tbl:pres-docs-freq-terms}, page \pageref{tbl:pres-docs-freq-terms} and \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-freq-terms}, page \pageref{tbl:congr-hearings-freq-terms}).  Then I present a series  of graphs are dendrograms of the terms of interest (see Table \ref{tbl:dictionary}, page \pageref{tbl:dictionary}). The figures display their association with others terms in the document collection. Again, the terms are all stemmed.

At the end I present two graphs of a different type, the correlation plot.  The first one (\ref{fig:pres-docs-corr-dic}, page \pageref{fig:pres-docs-corr-dic} and \ref{fig:congr-hearings-corr-dic}, page \pageref{fig:congr-hearings-corr-dic}) shows the terms in the above mentioned dictionary (Table \ref{tbl:dictionary}, page \pageref{tbl:dictionary}), and the second one (\ref{fig:pres-docs-corr-freq}, page \pageref{fig:pres-docs-corr-freq}) the most frequent terms.    While some associations are hardly surprising, such as "gap" and "achiev", others such as "math"-"scienc"-"nation" in the Congressional hearings are interesting.

** COMP Introduction							:sec:
#<<discussion-intro>>
The objective of this chapter is to combine the review of the literature search (see [[lit-review][Chapter 2]]) with the results from the *QDA* coding of the presidential and congressional statements (see [[findings-paragraphs][Section 4.4]]) and their text timing (see [[findings-words][Section 4.5]]) to answer the research question, how can Foucault's concept of /governmentality/ help us understand the federal political discourse on the achievement gaps (AGs).  The types of AGs that I consider are the ethnic/racial, income and international achievement gaps.  I organized the discussion of the findings according to the three dimensions of Michel Foucault's definition of /governmentality/ (\citeNP{Foucault:2009a}, see [[lit-review-governmentality][Section 2.4]]). As I have tried to show in Figure \ref{fig:governmentality} on page \pageref{fig:governmentality}, these definitions are not orthogonal and thus, at least partially, overlap.  Hence, some concepts are present and revisited in more than one of the three following sections.  It should be noted that each dimension corresponds roughly to one of the *QDA* code categories or themes that were defined in [[method-detailed-steps-I][Subsection 3.5.9]].

** STRT The ensemble 							:sec:
#<<discussion-dim-1>>
*** COMP Introduction						     :subsec:
#<<discussion-dim-1-intro>>
The first dimension of /governmentality/ was defined by Foucault as a *complex form of power* that is allowed by an ensemble of *institutions*, *procedures*, *analyses and reflections*, and *calculations and tactics* and is exercised on the *population* through the "apparatuses of security" and having political economy as *form of knowledge* (see [[lit-review-governmentality][Section 2.4]], point 1).  I have been able to find only a definition for the last term, /apparatuses of security/ as "techniques the government uses to provide society a feeling for economic, political, and cultural well-being." (see [[method-detailed-steps-I][Subsection 3.5.9]], page \pageref{method-detailed-steps-I}).

# ########################################
# Definitions of components of definition
# ########################################
It is difficult to discuss Michel Foucault's thoughts on governmentality, because in the sources it is not systematized.  We have to keep in mind that Foucault's ideas on the subject were never carefully expressed in a book or other type of publication.  We only have his lectures as recordings and some notes that were later reworked into "Security, Territory, and Population" and "Birth of the Biopolitics".  A further source of ambiguity is the Foucaultian concept of power/knowledge.  They can not be separated.  As can be seen in the above mentioned subsection, the definition of apparatus (/dispositif/ in French) includes both the institutions as organizations and the knowledge structures.  This makes sense as an institution is much more than the building it occupies, and the office furniture it contains and the people that work there.  The institution itself is based on a charter, a mission, a function, and the function itself is based on a perceived need in the society for certain tasks to be carried out.  If we ascend the causal ladder of any institution we will encounter a belief shared by most of society, a reason given for the existence of an institution that is a form knowledge and thus of power.  For instance most people will consider the school district a 'natural' part of society even if in reality there is no intrinsic reason at all for its existence.

How would we then discuss the first dimension of governmentality in relation to the achievement gaps?  Firstly, it we should not look at the institutions themselves because no new institutions were created to tackle the AGs. Rather new mandates were given to existing institutions, the US Department of Education or its predecessor the Office of Education, State and local education agencies, and the schools themselves.  Secondly, it would thus be more appropriate set aside the *institutions* to focus on the *procedures*, *analyses and reflections*, *calculations and tactics*, *population*, and *apparatuses of security*.  In other words, we should analyse with regard to the AGs how is it perceived as a problem that society needs to solve and what are the proposed remedies were.

As explained in [[method-detailed-steps-I][Subsection 3.3]] I have coded the source documents according to a scheme that I considered relevant to the discourse on the achievement gaps.  I have grouped these 39 codes into the items in the definition of the first dimension of governmentality as can be seen in Table \ref{tbl:dimension-1} on page \pageref{tbl:dimension-1}. The codes with a star are used in the discussion of the third dimension.  Some of the codes are considered within more than one definition item.

*** COMP Procedures						     :subsec:
#<<discussion-dim-1-procedures>>
How can we understand the governmentality *procedures* in the context of the discourse on the achievement gaps?  I think that we should frame it as the *procedures* that the federal, state, and local governments have created to solve or mitigate this problem.  The first time that the AGs are mentioned at the federal level of government and that the intent is expressed to solve them was with the "Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965" ("Strengthening and Improvement of Elementary and Secondary Schools", ESEA, 20 USC Chapter 70, see http://www.nctic1p.org/files/40646763.pdf). The following paragraph reproduces the "Declaration of Policy" of this law

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"SEC. 201. In recognition of the special educational needs of children of low-income families and the impact that concentrations of low-income families have on the ability of local educational agencies to
support adequate educational programs, the Congress hereby declares it to be the policy of the United States to provide financial assistance (as set forth in this title) to local educational agencies serving areas with concentrations of children from low-income families to expand and improve their educational programs by various means (including preschool programs) which contribute particularly to meeting the special educational needs of educationally deprived children.
#+END_QUOTE

We see that the procedure to be used by the federal government is to provide 'financial assistance' to 'local education agencies'.  Thus, federal funding of education was commenced and justified as a means to help raise the academic achievement of 'children of low-income families.'  It is interesting to note that no racial language is used, but only reference to income is made.  This situation changed when ESEA was re-authorized as NLCB in January 2002.  Thus, the 'pivot' of the federal education policy was a funding stream.  Funding is the *procedure* by which the US federal government had intended to guide and influence public education in the nation.  Even though the amount was small compared to the whole of the education budget of a state, it would make a significant difference in a school or school district with a low tax base.  ESEA includes directives on eligibility, payments, and reporting.  A complex network of exchanges of money and reports is established between the (then) Office of Education, the states and the school districts.  We could call the funding the main or primary *procedure* that then required secondary *procedures* such as reporting, and eligibility calculations and determinations.  The reform of ESEA, called the "No Child Left Behind Act of 2001" ("An act to close the achievement gap with accountability, flexibility, and choice, so that no child is left behind", NCLB, 107-110, see http://www2.ed.gov/admins/lead/account/nclbreference/reference.pdf), would expand on these procedures and require additional ones, such as teacher qualifications and school interventions.  Neoliberal ideology requires that the disbursement of public funds have a 'return on investment.'  Thus, as hinted in the complete title of NCLB, the concept of "accountability" is central to the NCLB reform (see [[discussion-dim-3-control-account][Subsection 5.4.7]], page \pageref{discussion-dim-3-control-account}).  Accountability by itself as a concept is more an *calculation and tactic* than a *procedure*, but its actualization is often called an "accountability system" and is expressed in a series of *procedures* that follow certain *calculations and tactics*.

This situation is reflected by the text mining analysis (see [[findings-words][Section 4.5]]) as well as the coding statistics (see [[findings-paragraphs][Section 4.4]]).  The word "accountability" ranks number 15 in word frequency in the Presidential documents (Table \ref{tbl:pres-docs-freq-terms}, page \pageref{tbl:pres-docs-freq-terms}) and number 12 in the Congressional hearings (Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-freq-terms}, page \pageref{tbl:congr-hearings-freq-terms}).  The rank is similar for the corresponding stemmed term "account".  In the correlation plots of the most frequent words we notice that the word "accountability" is directly connected to "system" (Fig. \ref{fig:pres-docs-corr-freq}, page \pageref{fig:pres-docs-corr-freq} and Fig. \ref{fig:congr-hearings-corr-freq}, page \pageref{fig:congr-hearings-corr-freq}).  In addition on the clustering dendrograms, where the most frequent terms in the collections are related, we can see that system is the closest term to accountability (Table \ref{tbl:pres-docs-assoc-account}, page \pageref{tbl:pres-docs-assoc-account}, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-assoc-account}, page \pageref{tbl:congr-hearings-assoc-account}; Fig \ref{fig:pres-docs-freq}, page \pageref{fig:pres-docs-freq}; Fig \ref{fig:congr-hearings-freq}, page \pageref{fig:congr-hearings-freq}).

The *QDA* code used for accountability (/SchoolAccount/) ranks number 8 out of 36 in the Presidential documents (Table \ref{tbl:pres-docs-number-codings}, page \pageref{tbl:pres-docs-number-codings}) and number 12 of 37 in the Congressional hearings (Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-number-codings}, page \pageref{tbl:congr-hearings-number-codings}).  Figures \ref{fig:pres-docs-cid-6-7-19} (page \pageref{fig:pres-docs-cid-6-7-19}) and \ref{fig:congr-hearings-cid-6-7-19} (page \pageref{fig:congr-hearings-cid-6-7-19}) provide a representation of the times that the concepts of accountability, achievement gaps, and funding are present in the Presidential documents and Congressional hearings.  We can see that around the year 2008 that accountability and the AGs are most frequently mentioned in the documents.

# SchoolAccount + EducGap
#
To obtain a more grounded understanding of accountability we need to analyze the paragraphs where it appears in conjunction with the achievement gaps and place them in their historical context.

We will now look at some of these documents.  Dr. Roderick Paige, the Secretary for Education of the first George W. Bush administration said on 2001-03-06

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
No Child Left Behind provides a new framework of accountability for ensuring that the Federal investment in Title I is well-spent and delivers the results intended when it was first authorized 36 years ago: closing the achievement gap between poor children and their more advantaged peers. The foundation of this new accountability framework is annual State assessments in reading and math for all students in grades 3-8, instead of the current law requirement for testing only twice during these critical formative years. The President's budget provides $320 million to help States develop and implement these additional assessments. (107shrg70756, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-senate}, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-executive}, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-107shrg70756})
#+END_QUOTE

This statement was given after the law was introduced in the U.S. Congress (2001-01-23), but before it was passed (2001-06-14).  The secretary stated that for 36 years ESEA had not been able to fulfil its purpose.  The remedy for this lack of efficacy was going to be 'accountability' in the form of yearly student assessments and additional funding.  We have thus the creation of a chain of governmental actions from a perceived problem, the income based AG (/analysis and reflection/) to federal funding of education (one /procedure/) to the lack of efficacy (/analysis and reflection/) to accountability (/calculation and tactic/) to yearly student assessments and increased funding (two /procedures/).  The reason of government has doubled the number of procedures.

President Bush in a speech made about two years later (2003-01-08) on the anniversary of the implementation of NCLB made a very similar statement

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In return for receiving Federal money, States must design accountability systems to measure whether students are learning to read and write and add and subtract. In return for a lot of money, the Federal Government, for the first time, is asking, "Are we getting the kind of return the American people want for every child?" (WCPD-2003-01-13-Pg39, Table \ref{tbl:docs-bush}, Table \ref{tbl:pres-docs-messages-bush})
#+END_QUOTE
 
The *tactic* of accountability creates however a self-feeding mechanism.  Money is given by the government, accountability is asked in return, that requires a whole set of other procedures such as testing and reporting that themselves require money.  Thus, a series of complex *calculations* of cost of assessment is set up and allocated between federal, state and local authorities with an intricate system of negotiation.  Hence, later in the same speech the president said

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The main reservations we've heard in the year since we passed the reform have come from some adults, not the children, who say the testing requirement is an unfunded mandate on the States. Well, that's not true. We put up $387 million to provide for testing, to pay for the testing in this year's budget. I intend to ask for the same amount next year. We demanded excellence. We're going to pay for the accountability systems to make sure that we do get excellence.
#+END_QUOTE

The original intent of ESEA was to provide additional funding to low-income schools for educational interventions and salaries for teachers and teacher assistants.  However, the "logic" of neoliberal government requires that a large amount be spent on the erection of bureaucratic structures that enlarge government itself to provide and manage accountability.  However, the procedures that accountability require, and that the president calls "measurement", have to be justified 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Accountability tells you what's going right, and it tells you what's going wrong, and it shows you where the emphasis needs to be. .... In States that measure, you'll find that the achievement gap is closing dramatically. (WCPD-2003-08-04-Pg984-2, Table \ref{tbl:docs-bush}, Table \ref{tbl:pres-docs-messages-bush})
#+END_QUOTE

President Bush sometimes placed the *tactic* of accountability and the *procedure* of measurement next to each other. For example "And as a result of strong *accountability measures* and good teachers and more funding, the results are positive," and "the way to determine whether or not reading programs work is to *measure*. If a child can read, it will show up on an *accountability system*." (WCPD-2004-01-12-Pg28)  The text mining of the Congressional hearing show that the term "measure" is fairly closely associated with "accountability" (0.21, see Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-assoc-account}, page \pageref{tbl:congr-hearings-assoc-account}).  In addition, the correlation plot of the relevant terms for this collection shows accountability directly connected to "assess", a form of measurement (Fig \ref{fig:congr-hearings-corr-dic}, page \pageref{fig:congr-hearings-corr-dic}).  The correlation plot of the most frequent terms in the Congressional hearings shows that "accountability" is directly related to "test" as well as "system" (Fig. \ref{fig:congr-hearings-corr-freq}, page \pageref{fig:congr-hearings-corr-freq}).  In the clustering dendrogram the closest terms to the couple "account" and "system" are "measure" and "rate" (Fig \ref{fig:congr-hearings-dic-account}, page \pageref{fig:congr-hearings-dic-account}).  The correlation plot of the most frequent terms of the Presidential documents connects "accountability" to "measure" and "measure" to "measure" (Fig. \ref{fig:pres-docs-corr-freq}).  Also, as in the case of the Congressional hearings, the cluster dendrogram has the term "measure" on the closest branch to the couple "account" and "measure" (Fig. \ref{fig:pres-docs-freq}, page \pageref{fig:pres-docs-freq}).  In the correlation plot of the Congressional hearings the term "assess" is directly connected to the term "system" which is part of the complex "accountability system" (see Figure \ref{fig:congr-hearings-corr-freq}).

# add coding statistical analysis results
In addition to the text mining also the coding statistics can provide us with information on the close relationship between accountability and measurement in the form of student.  Table \ref{tbl:pres-docs-cross-code} (page \pageref{tbl:pres-docs-cross-code}) and Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-cross-code} (page \pageref{tbl:congr-hearings-cross-code}) show that the second most frequently associated code to /SchoolAccount/ is /StudentAssess/ after /SchoolReform/.  The time graph Figure \ref{fig:congr-hearings-cid-6-19-28} shows that between 2006 and 2008 the trends of the codes for the AGs, schools accountability and student assessment are relatively high at the same time.  The data is less clear in the case of the Presidential documents (see Figure \ref{fig:pres-docs-cid-6-19-28}, page \pageref{fig:pres-docs-cid-6-19-28}) but still show during the same time that both the codes school accountability and student assessment increased.

The following quote shows how the president closely connects the /procedure of funding/ to the /tactic of accountability/ to the /procedure of student assessment/ and ending with a benefit for the /population/ through the public school system as an /apparatus of security/.  

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
And so, in return for increasing Federal spending, I said to Congress, "Why don't we insist that States measure early? Why don't we insist that there be strong accountability measures so we can determine whether curriculum are working, so we can correct a child's learning problems early before that child just moves through grade after grade?" (WCPD-2004-09-27-Pg2085)
#+END_QUOTE

However, by this time rhetoric had already collided with reality and the implementation of such a system of accountability had received opposition from many voices in the periphery of education politics.  Obvious objections that could be raised are that even the most elaborated and sophisticated system of measurement and reporting has a lag that greatly diminishes its utility.  Another is that what is measured may or may not be what is important or relevant to the educational process.  The president addressed the second objection a few times (see e.g. WCPD-2004-09-27-Pg2085).  Basically, President Bush stated that we are not going back to the (bad) old times and that the system is working.  See for instance

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
And so, now, in return for increased Federal money, States must design accountability systems which are able to determine whether or not we're meeting the high standards we've set. You cannot solve a problem until you diagnose it. And so the idea is to determine early in a child's career whether or not he or she can read and correct the reading problem today, before it's too late. We're closing a minority achievement gap in America. The system's working, and we're not going to go back to the old days of no accountability and no excellence in the classrooms, some of the classrooms of America. (WCPD-2004-10-11-Pg2223)
#+END_QUOTE

# text mining
The appeal of President Bush to 'hold the course' is also apparent in the text mining analysis.  Among the terms closely associated with "account" are "weaken" (0.19) and "lower" (0.17).  Those numbers reflect that often the president stated that we should not weaken or lower the accountability system (Table \ref{tbl:pres-docs-assoc-account}, page \pageref{tbl:pres-docs-assoc-account}).

Whether NCLB was working or not is not an issue in this analysis.  However, it has been the subject of education research. For example \citeA{Lee:2012b} have concluded that the narrowing of the AG was more closely associated with "long-term statewide instructional capacity and teacher resources rather than short-term NCLB implementation fidelity, rigor of standards, and state agency's capacity for data tracking and intervention."  Thus, measuring does not, at least in education, necessarily solve a problem.  It may do so in business where people can be hired and fired, lines of business can be initiated or terminated, but education works along different lines.  A school is more similar to a hospital, or, alas, a prison than to a business or factory.

We have previously seen the establishment of a governmental initiative spiral in the form of /procedure/ - /analysis & reflection/ - /calculation & tactics/ - new /procedure/.  Specifically from AG to yearly universal student assessments and additional funding.  There are also other spirals such as is mentioned in the following statement by the House Committee on Science

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
At its center, however, "No Child Left Behind" seeks to hold schools accountable for the progress of their students by requiring that all students in grades 3-8 be tested every year in reading and math (and, beginning in 2007, science), and that all students make "annual yearly progress" toward proficiency in these subjects.  Failure to do so results in a school being identified as "needing improvement," which triggers various interventions, such as additional funding, choices for parents and corrective actions. (108hhrg92513, 2004-03-18, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-house}, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-108hhrg92513})
#+END_QUOTE

The procedure for the determination of the Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) was by many considered unsatisfactory.  It could for legal reasons not be abolished, thus requests for its change were made.  A popular reform of the AYP was the adoption of 'growth models'.  Without going into the detail of what this entails, it suffices to say that it represents a significant complication where the test scores of each student would be tracked and compared over time.  One can only imagine the increase in data gathering, processing, storage, and analysis that the growth model would require.  The process of the calculation and notification of the YAP created through a chain of governmental causality a new process, the growth model. A House Committee on Education and the Workforce hearing was dedicated to this problematic (109hhrg28839, 2006-07-27, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-house}, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-109hhrg28839}).

Joel Klein, Chancellor of the New York City Department of Education made the following statement during this hearing that illustrates the increasing complexity of these /procedures/.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The sophisticated growth model we are crafting is another way we hold our schools accountable for providing New York City schoolchildren with the educations they need and deserve. Our new measure of progress will be more precise than what is required under No Child Left Behind.  We will measure all year-to-year gains, even those that don't boost students to proficiency, and all losses. I think this will be a vast improvement that will start placing incentives where they belong: on educating all students.
#+END_QUOTE

The following year (2007-03-21) a similar hearing was held by the same House Committee on Education and the Workforce (110hhrg34015, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-house}, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-110hhrg34015}).  Allan Olson, Co-Founder and Chief Academic Officer, Northwest Evaluation Association said during his statement

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If the nation is serious about accountability in education and about making sure that tax dollars invested in education result in a student population that is prepared for work and postsecondary education, we should not back away from the concept of testing. The issue is not whether or not to test but what kind of testing will yield the kind of information that actually helps teachers help students.  Expansion in the use of growth measures rather than one-shot grade-level tests can help educators, policymakers, and parents determine whether schools and students are actually making required progress toward proficiency. They also will tell educators, school board members, parents, and students what areas of learning they need to be working on to make desired growth targets.
#+END_QUOTE

We can appreciate from this excerpt how the procedure of testing is now a 'natural' aspect of school accountability, which itself has become a 'natural tactic' of school policy.  Notice also the proposal for 'expansion in the use of growth measures'.  Clearly an increase in sophistication and complexity of student assessment.  As such it would require more resources and administrative attention.  Finally, notice how at the end a mention is made of what would appear to be a benefit to the students themselves, but in reality is about the 'desired growth target', a governmental /calculation/.

The next president, Barack Obama, continued and even made more stringent the accountability requirements of his predecessor.  See for instance the following quote

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Now, before a State is even eligible to compete, they'll have to take an important first step. And this has caused some controversy in some places, but it shouldn't be controversial. Any State that has a so-called firewall law will have to remove them. Now, here's what a firewall law is. It basically says that you can't factor in the performance of students when you're evaluating teachers. That is not a good message in terms of accountability. So we said, if you've got one of those laws, if you want to compete for these grants, you got to get rid of that law.

Now, in some cases, that's going to mean restarting the school under different management as a charter school, as an independent public school formed by parents, teachers, and civic leaders who've got broad leeway to innovate. And some people don't like charter schools. They say, well, that's going to take away money from other public schools that also need support. Charter schools aren't a magic bullet, but I want to give States and school districts the chance to try new things. If a charter school works, then let's apply those lessons elsewhere. And if a charter school doesn't work, we'll hold it accountable, we'll shut it down. (DCPD-201000636, 2010-07-29)

This is an indication of how pervasive the neoliberal way of thinking about government in is US politics.  It crosses party lines.  This statement is even more surprising considering that is was made in front of a school audience.

For details about the QDA database searches performed for this subsection, please refer to [[qda-searches-procedures][Appendix Section S.1]]. 

*** COMP Analyses and Reflections				     :subsec:
#<<discussion-dim-1-analyses>>
I understand the /analyses and reflections/ to be the driving force of the expansion of the /administrative state/.  We have seen in the previous subsection ([[discussion-dim-1-procedures][5.2.2]]) examples of how the items of the first dimension definition of governmentality work with each other and create each other.  Tensions in society and the political sphere create discourses that engender political action that is actuated in the form of /procedures/.  They in their turn will create other tensions and so on.  Another source of tensions is the vast increase of data available to the body politic.  Not only data in the form of tables and graphs but also of more human contact through the media, travel and business.  Not need to dwell on the power of the images and reels of 9/11 and Katrina and how they have influenced the political discourse.

We will here examine some texts that in my opinion show this type of discourse.  We should keep in mind that often there is no clear distinction between and /analysis and reflection/ and the following item /calculations and tactics/.  The thinking is closely connected to the practice.  For instance the concept of the need for testing or other forms of accountability is close to the implementation of these ideas.  The concept of elimination of the achievement gap depends on the availability of the statistical /calculations/ and /reflections/ of social justice.  The necessity of the use of education research expresses itself in the legislated requirement to use  this /tactic/ in school reform.

Thus, the problem of the achievement gaps is in itself an /analysis and reflection/ and ESEA and NCBL are /apparatuses of security/ based on it.  In 1997 during a Senate hearing (105shrg39641, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-senate}, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-105shrg39641}) Carolyn Getridge, Superintendent of the Oakland Unified School District said the following

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We have, however, created a teachable moment of national proportion on issues of national urgency. Consequently, we also intend this testimony to add our perspective to solutions which address the underachievement of African-American and other minority children. Our reforms attempt to reform educational processes based on a system of "sorting", to a system of "achieving". We have fundamentally shifted our thinking from the right of students to attend school, to the right of students to achieve in school. (Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-local})
#+END_QUOTE

Notice the 'shifted our thinking', which indicates a new /analysis and reflection/ that goes beyond Brown versus Board of Education where the focus was 'equal opportunity' and now is 'equal results'.  That change of thinking has large implications in /calculations and tactics/ and /procedures/ as is repeatedly discussed in this chapter.  At the end of her statement the superintendent stated

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The New York Times reported this past week on the growing gap in achievement between white and minority students. These statistics are both mind-numbing and a cause for moral outrage. Katie Haycock, Executive Director of the Education Trust, which produced the report, stated that, "There are schools that are able to overcome the problems of urban life and get terrific results. The question is when are we going to make them the rule and not the exceptions. We think kids are achieving at low levels not because of poverty or because their parents are less well educated, but because we're systematically teaching them less."

The question is not, whether or not we must act; rather we are confronted by questions about how best to act, and how quickly can we act? The answers to these questions are not simple and they are not comforting. Quite to the contrary, the answers to these questions challenge some of the fundamental assumptions we have about the purpose and design of education.
#+END_QUOTE

In addition Carolyn Getridge made a reference to "A Nation at Risk" \cite{NCEE:1983a} as many will do in this period. In the two above paragraphs we see the beginning of a large political discourse on the AGs at a federal level.  We see the clash of two opposing /analyses and reflections/ with regard to the solving of the AGs, poverty versus schools.  We will notice that this will be an asymmetrical opposition where the 'poverty' pole is overshadowed by the 'school' pole.  By now the 'war on poverty' had faded from the public mind, a combination of its success and the ascendancy of neoliberalism.  The following quote by Dr. Eric J. Smith a superintendent in Maryland, closely expresses this /reflection/ 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The No Child Left Behind Act has transformed the debate about public education in America from blaming societal issues outside of schools' control to a focus on what we do control -- our ability to teach every child to rigorous standards.

# code statistics and text mining support of poverty/reform. Add pres-docs fig
Indeed is we look at the time chart of the codes for 'school/student poverty' and 'school reform' we can see that at the trend level in the Congressioanal hearings there is slightly more mention of the second concept that the first one (see Figure \ref{fig:congr-hearings-cid-26-33}).  The difference is much more evident in the Presidential documents (see Figure \ref{fig:pres-docs-cid-26-33}).  The text mining analysis does not show any association between the terms 'poverty' and 'reform'.  For the Congressional hearings see tables \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-assoc-poverti} and \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-assoc-reform}, and for the Presidential documents see tables \ref{tbl:pres-docs-assoc-poverti} and \ref{tbl:pres-docs-assoc-reform}.

With that in mind let us examine an excerpt from a statement given by Christopher J. Dodd, a Democratic Senator from Connecticut

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Today, low-income, minority, urban and rural children do not have equal educational opportunity, so that for many of them, the American promise is empty. This is simply unacceptable. Regardless of one's ideology, regardless of one's political persuasion, it ought to be as we enter the 21st century totally unacceptable that we would say to a child in America that your opportunity to succeed and to contribute to your family and this Nation depends upon the economic circumstances into which you were born. (107shrug79941, 2002-05-23, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-senate} and Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-107shrg79941})
#+END_QUOTE

The rhetoric conforms to what we would expect from a senator of the Democratic Party.  However, the political action from this type of /analysis and reflections/ would be substantially identical to those from the Republican Party and President Bush.  They all agree on funnelling large amounts of money from the federal treasury through a complex bureaucratic structure that would *not* place money in the hands of the poor, but rather support additional payroll for schools and school districts, consultants, professional development, furniture, technology, and tutoring.

The following quote is from a speech given by President William Clinton on 2000-6-15 during the White House Strategy Session on Improving Hispanic Student Achievement

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

The succeeding president, George Bush, made the following year (2001-01-23) a speech when he submitted NCLB to Congress.  In the following excerpt we can appreciate the /reflections and analyses/ of several problems pertaining to public education in the U.S. as well as economic ones

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We must confront the scandal of illiteracy in America, seen most clearly in high-poverty schools where nearly 70 percent of fourth graders are unable to read at a basic level. We must address the low standing of America test scores amongst industrialized nations in math and science, the very subjects most likely to affect our future competitiveness. We must focus the spending of Federal tax dollars on things that work. Too often, we have spent without regard for results, without judging success or failure from year to year. (WCPD-2001-01-29-Pg217, Table \ref{tbl:docs-bush} and Table \ref{tbl:pres-docs-messages-bush})
#+END_QUOTE

The connection between public education and economic competitiveness will be a very common /analysis and reflection/ in policy discourse for many years beginning about year 2004 (see Figure \ref{fig:pres-docs-cid-13-15-17} and Figure \ref{fig:congr-hearings-cid-13-15-17}).  As we will see, it is propounded by many politicians and policy experts over a wide ideological spectrum even though several education researchers had already contested this connection.  For instance Gerald \citeA{Bracey:1998a} quoted Lawrence Cremin (1990) who wrote in his /Popular Education and Its Discontents/

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
American economic competitiveness with Japan and other nations is to a considerable degree a function of monetary, trade, and industrial policy, and of decisions made by the President and Congress, the Federal Reserve Board, and the Federal Departments of the Treasury, Commerce and Labor.  Therefore, to conclude that problems of international competitiveness can be solved by educational reform, is not merely utopian and millennialist, it is at best a foolish and at worst a crass effort to direct attention away from those truly responsible for doing something about competitiveness and to lay the burden instead on the schools. (p. 69) 
#+END_QUOTE

More recently education research done by \citeA{Chen:2010a} unlinked the perceived connection between test scores in mathematics and science and labor-force quality.

In a speech given on 2003-07-28 at a conference of the National Urban League the president again made the connection between the economy and public education

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The truth of the matter is, the future of our economy and our country depend upon good schools in all our neighborhoods. Equal education is one of the most pressing civil rights of our day. Nearly half a century after Brown v. Board of Education, there's still an achievement gap in America. (WCPD-2003-08-04-Pg984-2, Table \ref{tbl:docs-bush} and Table \ref{tbl:pres-docs-messages-bush})
#+END_QUOTE

In addition he made an application to a very important civil right judgement made in 1954 that had wide ranging implications and gave justification of federal intervention on state and local matters.

Similar language was used later (WCPD-2004-05-17-Pg856)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We've got to do something about that. If we want this country to be a hopeful country for every citizen, if we want to make sure every person can realize the American Dream, we've got to close this gap. And what the accountability system -- they'll help us close that gap by determining who needs help. (WCPD-2004-05-17-Pg856)
#+END_QUOTE

# Code summaries and text mining
The text mining shows that the terms 'twentyfirst' and 'century' are ranked number 48 and 44 respectively by frequency in the Presidential documents (Table \ref{tbl:pres-docs-freq-terms}).  The expression "21st century" is almost always used in conjunction with economic competitiveness.  The connection plot in Figure \ref{fig:congr-hearings-corr-dic} shows that 'compet' is directly connected to 'pisa' and 'equal'.  These refer to the PISA international test and educational equality.  A similar situation exists in the Presidential documents.  In Figure \ref{fig:pres-docs-corr-dic} we see that the cluster 'compet', 'global' and 'economi' is connected to 'inequ', the term for educational inequity.  The cluster dendrogram of the Presidential documents (Figure \ref{fig:pres-docs-freq}) shows that the terms 'competit' and 'world' are closely related to 'skill' and 'abl', which are references to job skills of the students.

The need to close the AG is clearly expressed as a clear national duty and interest and accountability is the appropriate /tactic/ (see Figure \ref{fig:pres-docs-cid-12-14-19} and Figure \ref{fig:congr-hearings-cid-12-14-19}).  Again and again did President Bush make a connection between the AGs the economic health of the U.S. in 2004 (WCPD-2004-08-23-Pg1644-2, WCPD-2004-09-20-Pg2025, WCPD-2004-09-27-Pg2085, WCPD-2004-10-18-Pg2393, WCPD-2004-10-18-Pg2399).  The next year he stated "The achievement gap is starting to close, and that's good for the future of America." (WCPD-2005-07-18-Pg1158)  Similarly in 2006 the president said that "we have a moral obligation to make sure every child gets a good education. That's how I -- it's a moral obligation to make sure that we herald success and challenge failure." (WCPD-2006-01-16-Pg26-2)  "The No Child Left Behind Act is beginning to work. You know why?  Because we measure. There was an achievement gap in America; that's bad for the country." (WCPD-2006-03-27-Pg498)  "There's an achievement gap in America that's not good for the future of this country." (WCPD-2006-10-09-Pg1750)   "There's an achievement gap in America that better be closed if we want America to remain the leader of the world. It is unacceptable to me and it should be unacceptable to people across the country, we have an achievement gap in America." (WCPD-2007-04-30-Pg515)  "And it seems like to me, we've got to focus our efforts and energies on solving that problem if we want this country to be a hopeful country with a strong economy." (WCPD-2007-07-30-Pg1011)

Another /analysis and reflection/ is the need to use student assessment (see figures \ref{fig:pres-docs-cid-6-19-28} and \ref{fig:congr-hearings-cid-6-19-28}).  The president often uses the term "measurement" as a tool to improve public education

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
You cannot solve a problem until you diagnose a problem. And the No Child Left Behind Act is a diagnostic tool for local school districts. (WCPD-2006-01-23-Pg80-2)
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
... accountability can be used effectively, particularly if it's designed at the local level. In other words, you can use an accountability system to determine whether a curriculum is working, or you can use an accountability system to determine how your school district is doing relative to the school district next door to you. You can use an accountability system to determine whether or not we're closing an achievement gap that needs to be closed if America is going to be a promising place for all people -- not just some, but all people. (WCPD-2006-05-01-Pg769-2)
#+END_QUOTE

President Bush often repeats the assertion that this is a good tool to use and downplays or avoids altogether the use of it in "corrective interventions".  In reality that is the only use that the assessment /procedure/ will have.  The time lag between measurement and analysis and distance from the tested students to the bureaucracy in the local districts hinders greatly its usefulness for anything else than the calculation of the AYP.

It is interesting to observe how after the implementation of the education reform law, which was based on the /analysis and reflection/ of accountability, measurement, assessments to close the achievement gap, the law itself created new /analyses and reflections/ from its effects and efficacy.  The president would not accept any deviation from the principles that the law is based on as we can see in the following statement

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
But there is no debate about the results: the first time all 50 States and the District of Columbia have accountability plans in place. The data is being disaggregated. That means that we -- instead of just lumping all children together and say, "Oh, isn't everything beautiful," we actually break each child out to determine whether or not he or she is getting the kind of education parents and society expects. And that's an important reform. (WCPD-2009-01-12-Pg22-3)
#+END_QUOTE

It is worth noting that another /analysis and reflection/ that we have not mentioned is the principle that education practices have to be based on *experimental education research* (see figures \ref{fig:pres-docs-cid-6-9} and \ref{fig:congr-hearings-cid-6-9}).  The text of NCLB uses the term *scientifically based research* instead, but what is meant is that it should be based on the statistical analysis of experiments.  A couple of observations should be made on this regard (1) the grounding principles of NCLB themselves are not based on scientific research, but on neoliberal ideology, and (2) rarely is education research a purely experimental practice.  In most cases it is quasi-experimental because complete randomization and valid controls are almost impossible to obtain.  In addition, replicability and generalization are impossible.  Such a state of affairs should be expected in the practice of a social science such as education research.  See for instance

We have quadrupled Federal funding since 2001 for America's reading programs -- by the way, making sure that when we fund programs, that they use scientifically based programs, reading -- not programs that sound like they might work but programs which actually do work in teaching the children of America how to read. (WCPD-2004-05-17-Pg856)
#+END_QUOTE

His first Secretary of Education, Roderick Paige, made similar statements.  For example he said on 2001-03-06 during a Senate appropriations hearing

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Even more important, these new dollars are focused on changing the culture of our education system and closing the achievement gap. Our budget reflects the principles put forward in No Child Left Behind: high standards; annual testing of all students in grades 3-8 in reading and math; increased accountability for student performance; a focus on research-based practices -- particularly in teaching reading; reduced bureaucracy and greater flexibility for States, school districts, and schools; and expanded options for parents to make choices for their children's education. (107shrg70756, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-107shrg70756})
#+END_QUOTE

Several years later in 2010 during a Senate hearing on the ESEA re-authorization there was an appeal for "evidence-based reforms" by John Castellani, President of the Business Roundtable (111shrg55474, 2010-03-09, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-111shrg55474}).  As I have remarked, all education reforms (ESEA, NCLB, and RTTT) are not based on scientific evidence, but on political/economic ideology.

The following excerpt by President Bush shows that the /analysis and reflection/ of research based educational intervention is closely related to the /analysis and reflection/ of measurement

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Let me stop you right there. Notice she said "research-based." In other words, what that means is, people have actually looked at what works and have incorporated what works into the textbooks. That's what we want. We want curriculum that actually achieves our objectives. Remember the old reading debates -- there was -- sometimes people had this notion about what might work, and we never knew whether it was or not until we started to measure. (WCPD-2004-09-27-Pg2085)
#+END_QUOTE

The following quote is from a statement made by President George Bush at Tuskegee University in Alabama on 2006-04-19.  I reproduced a fair portion of it because it ties several of the /analyses and reflections/ that we have discussed here

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We need to do the same thing for math. We need to make sure that our teachers, our school boards, our principals, our superintendents, our Governors understand what works. You cannot set an objective and achieve that objective unless you have the tactics necessary to do that. And so we're going to call the experts together. They'll be presenting a report to Margaret and myself by January 31st of 2007. It will be a really important study, because, again, it will give -- it will help States and local school districts have the methodology, the teaching methods necessary to help achieve an important objective.

And then we're going to implement what's called a Math Now program that will get those recommendations into the teacher's hands. But there's also another interesting aspect of Math Now, which I think is vital, and that is, when we measure and find a child slipping behind in math in the eighth or ninth grade, that child gets extra help. We do that in the third and fourth grades when it comes to reading; we need to apply that same standard of help for a child as they head into the high school.

If you want to deal with the problem of the United States of America falling behind in math and science, you focus on the problem, and you focus on it with what works and money and extra help. And that's exactly what we intend to do to make sure that we begin to lay that foundation for a competitive tomorrow. (WCPD-2006-04-24-Pg734)
#+END_QUOTE

A distressing observation that can be made about this insistence on education research is that it implies that college of education are failing in their preparation of teachers.  A complete Senate hearing was dedicated to the subject of educational research (107shrg80479, 2002-06-25, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-107shrg80479}).

After about 8 years from the implementation of NCLB President Bush was succeeded by President Obama.  His thinking about the achievement gaps and their social and economic implications does not seem different as can be read in these following excerpts from some of his speeches on the subject

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
when countries that outeducate us today will outcompete us tomorrow, a world-class education is a prerequisite for success. (DCPD-200900575)

But we also know that today, our education system is falling short. We've talked about it for decades, but we know that we have not made the progress we need to make. The United States, a country that has always led the way in innovation, is now being outpaced in math and science education. African American, Latino students are lagging behind white classmates in one subject after another, an achievement gap that, by one estimate, costs us hundreds of billions of dollars in wages that will not be earned, jobs that will not be done, and purchases that will not be made. And most employers raise doubts about the qualifications of future employees, rating high school graduates' basic skills as only fair or poor. (DCPD-200900595)
#+END_QUOTE

There is a minor /analysis and reflections/ concerning the AG, namely the implications for the social fabric of the nation (see figures \ref{fig:pres-docs-cid-6-16} and \ref{fig:congr-hearings-cid-6-16}).  For instance, Michael A. Rebell, Executive Director of the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, Inc., made the following statement

In the decades ahead, as non-white students increasingly constitute the majority of the populations in States including California, Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana, and New Mexico, the societal costs of allowing these inequities to remain unchecked and unremedied will become progressively more intolerable and unacceptable to business leaders and to the Nation as a whole. (107shrg79941, 2002-05-23, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-orgs} and Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-107shrg79941})
#+END_QUOTE

Michael Rebell has also published on this topic \cite<e.g. see>{Rebell:2008a}.  Later Lori Sturdevant of the Minneapolis Star Tribune made a similar statement (109hhrg27978, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-109hhrg27978}).  However, notice that these statements do not come from politicians.  In addition, as time goes on and the competitive standing of the U.S. vis-à-vis the rest of the world worsens (see [[discussion-dim-3-control-econ][Subsection 5.4.3]]) there is a shift in emphasis from the income/racial/ethnic AG to the /international/global AG as the attention to poverty fades from the public consciousness.  See for example the statement by Nick Smith, Chairman of the Research Subcommittee of the House Science Committee, Republican Party (108hhrg90162, 2003-10-30, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-108hhrg90162}).  

# EducMathSci
The last type of /analysis and reflection/ that I would like to examine is the importance given by politicians and education policy experts to mathematics and science education (see figures \ref{fig:pres-docs-cid-6-8} and \ref{fig:congr-hearings-cid-6-8}).  An obvious sign of this importance is the fact that NCLB contains the following

#+END_QUOTE

We see here above the policy discourse connection between public education and economic competitiveness.  The 'missing link' between these two concepts is the teaching of mathematics and science as the following quotes show

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The future of the Nation depends on a strong, competitive workforce and a citizenry well equipped to function in an increasingly complex and interdependent world. While the most recent results of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) show that student achievement is generally up over the last 30 years, large numbers of U.S. students demonstrate a mastery of only rudimentary mathematics. (108hhrg91364, House Committee on Science and Technology, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-108hhrg91364})

Truly, the areas of math and science are essential to our youth as well as to the health of our nation. (109hhrg20424, Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, Democrat, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-representative}, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-109hhrg20424})

The importance of STEM education for the Nation's future well being has been stressed in many reports over the past few years, most recently by the Augustine report from the National Academies, Rising Above the Gathering Storm. (109hhrg26798, Representative Bart Gordon, Democrat, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-representative}, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-109hhrg26798})

In conclusion, Business Roundtable is on the same page as the National Science Board in terms of the depth and urgency of the problem with regard to STEM education in the United States. Like the Board, Business Roundtable believes the highest priority for STEM education policy should be recruiting, training and retaining many more well-qualified STEM teachers. (110hhrg38056, Susan Traiman, Director of Education and Workforce Policy at Business Roundtable, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-110hhrg38056})

Today's world is one where STEM fields have become directly related to the ability of modern societies to generate wealth and provide for a vibrant economic environment for their citizens. If we want the most vital U.S.A. to exist tomorrow, we must plant the seeds for that today by investing in the strongest possible STEM education for all our citizens. (111shrg67045, Dr. S. James Gates, University of Maryland, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-111shrg67045})

We need to focus on math and science to make sure our youngsters have the skills necessary to compete in this world. (WCPD-2004-08-23-Pg1644-2, President George Bush, Table \ref{tbl:docs-bush}

# text mining and summary code stats EducMathSci
The *QDA8 code for the mathematics and science education ranks number 6 in the Presidential documents (Table \ref{tbl:pres-docs-number-codings} and Congressional hearings (Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-number-codings}).  In addition this coding is present in 124 out of 127 Presidential documents (Table ref{tbl:pres-docs-files-code}) and 79 out of 89 Congressional hearings (Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-files-code}).  The code cross tables for both document collections show a large overlap between mathematics and science education and the achievement gaps (Table \ref{tbl:pres-docs-cross-code} and Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-cross-code}).

Text mining, likewise, shows the relevance of the teaching of mathematics and science.  The term 'math' ranks number 9 (unstemmed) or 11 (stemmed) in the Presidential documents (Table \ref{tbl:pres-docs-freq-terms}).  The term 'science' ranks 37 and 45 respectively.  In the Congressional hearings the term 'math' ranks number 7 (unstemmed) and 8 (stemmed) while 'science' ranks 10 and 17 respectively (Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-freq-terms}).  Unsurprisingly, the term most frequently associated to 'math' is 'science' (see tables \ref{tbl:pres-docs-assoc-math} and \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-assoc-math}).

The correlation graph of most frequent terms in the Congressional hearings shows that 'math' is connected to 'science', which in turn is connected to 'nation' (Figure \ref{fig:congr-hearings-corr-freq}).

As we have mentioned at the beginning of this subsection, the is a close link between an /analysis and reflection/ and a /tactic/, in this case the implementation of mathematics teaching with the related tactics of mathematics and science teacher retention, professional education, formation and recruitment. Those concepts are discussed in the next subsection ([[discussion-dim-1-calculations][5.2.4]]).

For details about the QDA database searches performed for this subsection, please refer to [[qda-searches-analyses-reflections][Appendix Section S.2]]. 

*** COMP Calculations and Tactics				     :subsec:
#<<discussion-dim-1-calculations>>
I will make an almost literal interpretation of "calculations" as the mathematical calculations, or more accurately, algorithms that use descriptive statistics and are based on data collection.  A prime example of this  type of calculation is the determination of the Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) as specified in NCLB.  An earlier example is are the calculations for allocation of the Title I funds in ESEA.

Table \ref{tbl:dimension-1} shows the QDA codes that I have applied to this item of the definition of the first dimension of Foucault's governmentality.   One aspect of /calculations and tactics/ is the level of governmental control of education with respect to the achievement gap.   That subject is extensively discussed in [[discussion-dim-3-federal-local][Subsection 5.4.2]] and I will thus only make this brief mention here.

I have previously mentioned accountability, at school, school district, and state level vis-à-vis the federal government as a /procedure/ (see [[discussion-dim-1-procedures][Subsection 5.2.2]]) and /analysis and reflection/ (see [[discussion-dim-1-analyses][Subsection 5.2.3]]).  The application of this concept requires extensive /calculations/ (the standardized test scores, AYP) and several /tactics/ such as the assessment of students (figures \ref{fig:pres-docs-cid-6-19-28} and \ref{fig:congr-hearings-cid-6-19-28}), the assessment and professional development of teachers (figures \ref{fig:pres-docs-cid-35-37} and \ref{fig:congr-hearings-cid-35-37}), the notification of parents, the reporting to the U.S. Department of Education and so on.  Regarding /calculations/, there has been a lot of discussion on how to calculate AYP.  Also in [[discussion-dim-3-federal-local][Subsection 5.2.2]] is a description of the discussion on but a small aspect of the AYP, the so called N-size.  The fact that a minor aspect of NCLB could engender such a bitter discussion is a sign that /calculations/ occupy an important place in the /administrative state/.  Another albeit lesser statistical controversy in on the use of confidence intervals in AYP calculations, a relatively sophisticated statistical concept (see 110hhrg37638).  Even more mathematically complex are the discussions on growth models, value added models and their comparisons (see 109hhrg28839).

As is explained in more detail in [[discussion-dim-3-federal-local][Subsection 5.4.2]] the trend in the /administrative state/ in the U.S.A. is to more and more functions and control from the periphery to the center.  Curriculum standards follow this trend.  We have at the beginning mention of the formation of state-wide standards

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The "Improving America's Schools Act of 1994," which reauthorized the ESEA 5 years ago, and the "Goals 2000: Educate America Act" gave States and school districts a framework for integrating Federal resources in support of State and local reforms based on high academic standards. In response, 48 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico have adopted State-level standards. (WCPD-1999-05-31-Pg964, 1999-05-31, President William Clinton, Table \ref{tbl:docs-clinton})
#+END_QUOTE

There was in 1997 a request for a national standard by Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, but it was an isolated voice.  He himself admitted that Congress was opposed to it (105shrg39641, 1997-01-23, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-105shrg39641}).

President George many times mentioned 'high standards', that is a term he uses for state standards in the context of NCLB.  His first Secretary of Education would use the term 'State academic standards' (e.g. 107shrg70756, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-107shrg70756}, 2001-03-06).

Once state standards are in place the next /tactic/ would be to exert control over these state curricula, but without calling it or making it a national standard.  This can be seen in the following quote by Kati Haycock, director of The Education Trust

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Just as averages can mask under-achievement by some groups of students, so too can standards that are not sufficiently rigorous. If schools can meet their goals not only based on students that are meeting standards, but also on growth toward these standards, it becomes even more important to have meaningful, high-level standards. As Congress considers allowing states to incorporate growth into accountability, it is important to revisit the hands-off approach that has ignored the rigor of state standards. (109hhrg28839, 2006-07-27, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-109hhrg28839})
#+END_QUOTE

Note the critique of the 'hands-off approach' as a call for federal intervention and control.  The first concrete call for national standards came the following year from an organization not part of the government.  Hon. Robert Wise, President of the Alliance for Excellent Education and former governor said in a statement on 2007-04-23

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
NCLB should establish a process for developing shared education standards to ensure that all students are held to the same high expectations aligned with the requirements of postsecondary education and the workforce. The federal government should also offer states high-quality performance assessments to regularly measure student progress towards those standards and fulfill the testing requirements of NCLB. This action would remove a significant financial burden from states and increase the quality of assessments. In addition, the federal government should provide states with incentives and supports for adopting such standards and aligning them with their key systems, such as their curricula, graduation requirements, and professional development. (110hhrg34631, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-110hhrg34631})
#+END_QUOTE

It is interesting to notice that an appeal is made to economic considerations, an /analysis and reflection/.  This excerpt was in a section of his statement titled "Voluntary National Standards".  That is, the U.S. government would provide the standards, but would have been up to the state to accept them or not.  However, national standards would come about in a different fashion.  See the following excerpt from a statement by Chester Finn of the Hoover Institution at Standford University

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The surest way to end this such questionable practices -- and keep Washington from playing a cat-and-mouse game with recalcitrant states -- is to move to a system of national standards and tests, while simultaneously freeing states, districts, and schools to achieve those standards as they see fit.
 
To be very clear, federal officials do not themselves need to, and in my view should not, create such national standards and tests themselves. But the federal government could require or encourage their use. (110hhrg35664, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-110hhrg35664})
#+END_QUOTE

Indeed the federal government would not create a national standard but by the states themselves as will in 2009 as is shown in [[discussion-dim-3-federal-local][Subsection 5.4.2]].  Text mining confirms that importance of this /tactic/.  The term 'standard' (stemmed) ranks number 6 in the Presidential documents collection (Table \ref{tbl:pres-docs-freq-terms}) and number 25 in the Congressional hearings (Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-freq-terms}).  There is an association between the terms 'standard' and 'common' (0.23) in the Presidential documents (Table \ref{tbl:pres-docs-assoc-standard}).

# TeacherApprec
Now I would like to examine briefly the /tactic/ of "teacher appreciation", that is the incentives, monetary or promotion or less tangible, that the government and school administration give to particular teachers to encourage certain types of behaviour, from just applying for teaching positions to increasing student achievement (See figures \ref{fig:pres-docs-cid-34} and \ref{fig:congr-hearings-cid-34}).  The reverse of this /tactic/ are certain punitive practices that could eventually result in the dismissal of teachers.  The pivot between these two /tactics/ has become the /tactic/ of "teacher assessment".  This last /tactic/ is but an extension involving slightly more complicated /calculations/ of the /tactic/ "student assessment" that was discussed in the previous subsection ([[discussion-dim-1-procedures][5.2.2]]).

The tendency has been for these three /tactics/ to operate within the ideological framework of neoliberalism as can be seen in the following excerpt of a statement by President Bush

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We'll do more to improve education and prepare our children for the future. Listen, we've got a changing job force. Most new jobs are filled by people with at least 2 years of college, yet one in four of our students gets there. That's why, at our high schools, we'll fund early intervention programs to help at-risk students. We'll emphasize math and science so our kids can fill the jobs of the 21st century. We'll reward teachers who gets results for their students. We'll give our best teachers incentives to teach in the neediest schools. Over time, we'll require a rigorous exam before graduation. By raising performance in our high schools and expanding Pell grants for low and middle-income Americans, we will help more of our citizens start their career with a college diploma. (WCPD-2004-09-27-Pg2097, 2004-09-22, \ref{tbl:docs-bush})
#+END_QUOTE

It is interesting to observer that during the initial stage of a /procedure/ that impinges on the autonomy of an agent in society only its positive side in mentioned, "we'll reward teachers ..."  Once the practice is part of the "system of knowledge", then its 'other' side is mentioned and applied.  See also WCPD-2005-01-17-Pg45.  Marlene S. Shaul, Director, Education, Workforce, and Income Security Issues, U.S. Government Accountability Office stated "States used them [i.e. growth models] for purposes such as rewarding effective teachers and designing intervention plans for struggling schools." (109hhrg28839, 2006-07-27, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-109hhrg28839})  Again, assessments are used only to reward teachers.  However, the following year (2007-05-11) the final stage of this tactic triplet is shown in a statement by John D. Podesta, President and Chief Executive Officer, Center for American Progress, a progressive policy organization (http://www.americanprogress.org)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Compensation systems that recognize the value of our teacher workforce coupled with career advancement systems that more effectively reward good performance, draw effective educators to high-need schools, and respond to poor performance, including fairly and effectively removing ineffective educators, will make larger investments in teacher and principal salaries more politically viable and maximize the returns on such investments. (110hhrg34990, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-109hhrg28839})
#+END_QUOTE

Note that this process is 'fair and efficient'.  Of course these 'compensation systems' do not exists and no guarantee is given that such 'fair and efficient' systems could be devised.
President Barack Obama will three years later give a very similar statement

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
But let me be clear: Success should be judged by results, and data is a powerful tool to determine results. We can't ignore facts; we can't ignore data. That's why any State that makes it unlawful to link student progress to teacher evaluations will have to change its ways if it wants to compete for a grant. That's why the Race to the Top grants will go to States that use data effectively to reward effective teachers, to support teachers who are struggling, and when necessary, to replace teachers who aren't up to the job. (DCPD-200900595, 2009-07-24, Table \ref{tbl:docs-obama})
#+END_QUOTE

This is a quintessential neoliberal discourse which would seem out of place in a speech by a Democratic president.  Surely a sign of how pervasive this type of ideology is in the U.S. political discourse.  However, reality has a complexity that ideology can not perceive

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
When asked how she [Susan Saunders, an experienced teacher] would feel about working in this new system of test-based merit pay, Saunders said the introduction of the system would force a teacher like herself either to leave the system or to stop taking on the special education students and helping the other teachers in her building (since one teacher's greater success would come at the expense of another teacher's rating). (110shrg34052, 2007-03-06, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-110shrg34052})
#+END_QUOTE

In other words, prescriptive rules and regulations are destined to fail because societies are too complex.  There are always what Linda Darling-Hammond calls them "unintended negative consequences" (see 110hhrg34015, 110hhrg34990, 110hhrg35664, and 110hhrg37638).

*** COMP Population						     :subsec:
#<<discussion-dim-1-population>>
Micheal Foucault's understanding of population and governmentality is complex and we can not explore all aspects here \cite[chps 3 and 4]{Foucault:2009a} in detail.  However, for our purposes here we need to state that "population" is the target of all the previously discussed /procedures/, /analyses and reflections/, /calculations and tactics/.  The following quotes from his third lecture on "Security, Territory, Population" shew some light in his understanding of the term[fn:122]

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I think the population no longer appears as a collection of subjects of right, as a collection of subject wills who must obey the sovereign's will through the intermediary of regulations, laws, edicts, and so on.  It will be considered as a *set of processes* to be *managed* at the level and on the basis of what is *natural* in these processes. (p. 70)

What is it that means that the population will henceforth be seen ... as a sort of technical-political object of management and government?

The population is a datum that depends on a *series of variables*, which means that it cannot be transparent to the sovereign's action and that the relation between the population and sovereign cannot simply be one of obedience or the refusal of obedience, of obedience or revolt.

... the naturalness identified in the fact of population is constantly accessible to *agents and techniques of transformation*, on condition that these agents and techniques are at once *enlightened, reflected, analytical, calculated, and calculating*.

... the *naturalness of desire* ... marks the population and becomes accessible to *governmental technique*

The population is not, then, a collection of juridical subjects in an individual or collective relationship with a sovereign will.  It is a set of elements in which we can note constants and regularities even in accidents, in which we can identify the *universal of desire* regularly producing benefit of all, and with regard to which we can identify a number of *modifiable variables*  on which it depends.

... with the population we have something completely different from a collection of subjects of right differentiated by their status, localization, goods, responsibilities, and offices: we have a set of elements that, on one side, are immersed within the *general regime of living beings* and that, on another side, offer a surface on which authoritarian, but *reflected and calculated transformations* can get a hold.

The public ... is the population seen under the aspect of its opinions, ways of doing things, forms of behaviour, customs, fears, prejudices, and requirements; it is what one gets a hold on through *education*, campaigns, and convictions.
#+END_QUOTE

From the above quotes that shine light on the Foucaultian notion of /population/ it should be noted that it does not directly correspond to the student population.  The target of ESEA were poor families and its provisions had the function of *modifying variables*, school quality and job training that would lift them out of poverty.  It was assumed that desire of the target population to leave poverty would be the driving force of their positive behaviour.  However, school policy is complicated by the fact that there is no direct and close temporal relationship between the intervention, the supposedly improved school environment, and the benefit to the population, i.e. increased earning potential, cultural wealth, and social skills.  Thus, the governmental interventions are at best less effective.  Indeed the students were not considered part of the population itself, it had no *agency*.  Even worse, the *universal of desire* of most students after elementary school is almost exactly the opposite of what all the education laws intend to obtain, academic achievement.  In my understanding of Foucault's governmentality of the population, the administrative state works the best when government interventions can work *with* the natural desires of the populations not against them.  Thus, the ideal setting of governmentality is the democratic society where the desire of most of the population is generally in agreement with the spirit of its laws and regulations.  Comparing a professional army (e.g. U.S.A.) to a conscripted army (e.g. Russia) one will notice a large difference in disciplinary issues as well as in efficacy.  The average patient in a general hospital does not need the type of surveillance that a patient in a psychiatric unit does.  There are no disciplinary problems in a library, few in a summer camp, but many in a public school, even a suburban one.

# Parental involvement
These observations would explain why in the reform of ESEA, NCLB, mention is made of parental involvement (see figures \ref{fig:pres-docs-cid-18} and \ref{fig:congr-hearings-cid-18}).  Even tough NCLB considers student little more than raw material, the law recognizes a large degree of *agency* to the parents of the students.  See for example the following quotes by President Bush

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
A child who cannot identify the letters of the alphabet in his or her first year of school runs a real risk of staying behind in school throughout her or his career. We cannot accept this in America. To close the achievement gap in our schools, we must close the early childhood education gap in our society. Today I pledge my administration's support in working with parents and families, Head Start and childcare centers, and our States to achieve this goal.  (WCPD-2002-04-08-Pg551-2, 2002-04-02, Table \ref{tbl:pres-docs-messages-bush})

The only way to be sure of whether or not every child is learning is to test regularly and to show everybody, especially the parents, the results of the tests. (WCPD-2003-01-13-Pg39, 2003-01-08)

And so the No Child Left Behind Act sets high expectations and high standards. It believes in local control of schools. It believes in empowering parents. (WCPD-2004-08-23-Pg1644-2, 2004-08-18)

There is an achievement gap in America that is inexcusable, and it's beginning to close. And I think one of the main reasons it's closing is because we are now measuring. We're posting scores on the Internet for people to see, and we're saying to school districts, "If you've got a problem, correct it early, before it is too late. And if you can't figure out how to correct it, give parents a different option than keeping their child in a school which will not change and will not teach." (WCPD-2006-01-09-Pg12, 2006-01-06)

Measuring results empowers parents with valuable information about schools, so they can push for change if it's needed. Measuring results means schools are working to close the achievement gap, instead of looking the other way when a student is struggling or falling behind. (WCPD-2007-10-15-Pg1318-2, 2007-10-09)

Charter schools are educational alternatives that empower families with additional choices for their children. By providing flexibility to educators while insisting on results, charter schools are helping foster a culture of educational innovation, accountability, and excellence.  Charter schools also encourage parental involvement and help contribute to the national effort to close the achievement gap. (WCPD-2008-05-05-Pg650-2, 2008-05-02)
#+END_QUOTE

Other participants in the political discourse expressed very similar opinion.  See for example

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
NCLB creates an authority for funding of Parental Assistance Information Centers and Local Family Information Centers (LFICs) to provide training, information, and support to parents, and to individuals and organizations that work with parents, to implement parental involvement strategies that lead to improvements in student academic achievement. The information and training provided by these centers is critical to prepare parents to hold schools accountable for closing the achievement gap. (James H. Wendorf Executive Director, National Center for Learning Disabilities, 108hhrg92309, 2004-03-03, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-108hhrg92309})

Parents have information not only on their own child's achievement, but on how that achievement compares to his/her subgroup within the school, the school as a whole, the school district and the state. Parents can shop for schools, if they are able, with better ``consumer information.'' They can decide whether to try to take advantage of NCLB's transfer provisions if their child is in a school ``in need of improvement.'' And parents, acting together or through organizations like the NAACP in Connecticut, can organize and pressure their state and local officials to do a better job in improving their schools and ensuring the high-quality teachers and resources they need to succeed. (John C. Brittain, Chief Counsel and Senior Deputy Director, Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, 109hhrg28431, 2006-06-13, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-109hhrg28431})

And when schools do not improve, students and their parents have new options, including transferring to a better-performing school or obtaining high-quality supplemental educational services. (Margaret Spellings, US Secretary of Education, 109shrg20732, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-109shrg20732})
#+END_QUOTE

We can see in the above quotes how several /tactics/, /calculations/, and /reflections/ *supposedly* work together in the amelioration of a social problem, the AGs.  Measurement gives information to parents, the *agents* in an *educational marketplace* who will act on their natural desire, the well being of their children, to raise the quality of the schools by choosing a better school, then schools would compete for students by increasing their quality and thus eliminate the achievement gap.  According to classical economics competition in a free and transparent marketplace increases quality, lowers prices, and maximizes production efficiency.

Maybe private schools operate in a free market system, but certainly public schools do not, regardless whether NCLB pretends it is so.  You place of residence determines the public school you go to and there are penalties for violating this rule.  Even in the rare cases that parents could choose between different public schools it may not be possible to change due to transportation issues.  Due to the usual poor status of public transportation in the U.S.A. if the school bus does not provide transportation the school may be unreachable.  Such opinion and sentiments are expressed in the following excerpts.  Notice that all except one are by non politicians.  Representative McKeon is a conservative Republican and by 2007 it was evident that NCLB would not attain its goals.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
As Wisconsin State Representative Polly Williams observed: "School choice empowers low-income families ... Parents with money can use it as a leverage in decision making. Low-income families are stuck in a non-responsive system." State and Local GI Bills for Children will give middle- and low-income families the power to vote with their feet if they are not satisfied with the educational product of the school. (Hoover Institution on War, Revolution and Peace , 108shrg94993, 2004-07-15, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-108shrg94993})

Decades of school choice research has documented two very clear, consistent findings that pertain to our discussion today about Pell Grants for Kids: First, school choice is associated with high levels of parent involvement, commitment and empowerment. Second, school choice policies must address questions of equity that often emerge because of differential access to information and transportation between advantaged and disadvantaged families. (Ellen B. Goldring, Vanderbild University, 108shrg94993)

The typical operation of school districts exacerbates the problems facing high schools, since the procedures of school districts are built around assumptions of unequal outcomes and large size. School resources are distributed in ways that provide the best teachers and more congenial learning settings to the students who are the most able.  Effective political pressure from affluent parents tends to reinforce these dysfunctional practices. (Andres Henriquez, Carnegie Corporation, 109hhrg21648, 2005-06-09, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-109hhrg21648})

And, yes, parents do have more options when it comes to giving their child the best possible education, but there still aren't enough options available or utilized. (Representative Howard McKeon, Republican, 110jhrg33757, 2007-03-13, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-110jhrg33757})
#+END_QUOTE

Even though parental involvement is not one of the principal /tactics/ it is a subject that is often mentioned in the policy documents.  The term 'parent' (stemmed) is ranked number 22 in the Presidential documents (Table \ref{tbl:pres-docs-freq-terms}) and its QDA code is ranked number 18 in the same collection.  However, its code is only ranked number 27 in the Congressional hearings and it does appear among the 50 most common terms.  President Bush, unlike other speakers, almost always mentioned this concept when speaking about the importance and virtues of NCLB.  In the cluster dendrogram of the Presidential documents the term 'parent' is closely associated with the coupled terms 'accountability' and 'system' (Figure \ref{fig:pres-docs-freq}).

Another observation that can be done regarding ESEA is that interventions on school faculty and administration were negligible.  This would change with its successor, NCLB, and even more later with RTTT (http://www2.ed.gov/programs/racetothetop/index.html).  We will at this more in [[discussion-dim-1-apparatuses][Subsection 5.2.7]], however here I would like to say that NCLB and RTTT include /processes/, /agents and techniques of transformation/ that by /calculations/ have the function of modifying the fashion by which school faculty and management operate.  There are /supportive/ as well as /punitive/ measures in the law that intend to operate on the *naturalness of desire* of the teachers and principals to retain their employment, retain or even increase their income, and avoid shame.

# StudentPoverty
As we have previously seen in [[discussion-dim-1-procedures][Subsection 5.2.2]], the first federal education law, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, was passed with the intend to solve the income-based achievement gap (see figures \ref{fig:pres-docs-cid-26-33} and \ref{fig:congr-hearings-cid-26-33}).  For instance President Clinton said in 1999

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The bill [i.e. his ESEA re-authorization proposal] also would continue to target Federal elementary and secondary education resources on those students furthest from meeting State and local standards, with a particular emphasis on narrowing the gap in achievement between disadvantaged students and their more affluent peers. (WCPD-1999-05-31-Pg964, Table \ref{tbl:docs-clinton})
#+END_QUOTE

Later political discourse would prefer more racial and then even later ethnic terminology with regards to the AGs.  Sometimes the more 'bland' terms "minorities" or "of color" would be used.  President Obama said at the beginning of his term at an NAACP (http://www.naacp.org) meeting "There are overcrowded classrooms and crumbling schools and corridors of shame in America filled with poor children, not just black children, brown and white children as well. (DCPD-200900575, 2009-07-16, Table \ref{tbl:docs-obama})"  I suppose that "brown" is a generic term for non Black minority. After all there was no need at an NAACP meeting to be more specific.  Likewise the more vague term SES (socio-economic status) is often used instead of poverty.

There are research papers on the AGs where poverty versus race or ethnicity is mentioned or even the research topic.  See for instance \citeA{Lee:2009a,McMahon:2011a,Long:2009a,Chatterji:2005a,Hallinan:2010a,Jordan:2003a,Garrett:2009a}.
How could the /administrative state/ solve or at least mitigate the poverty based AG?  Which /procedures/ should be implemented?  The obvious solution would be the elimination of poverty itself, the cause of the problem and certainly a problem in and by itself.  The War on Poverty by President Lyndon B. Johnson (1964) aimed to do just so.  The text of the President Johnson's address to Congress in reproduced in  http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1964johnson-warpoverty.html  Poverty can be ameliorated using several methods and probably the best form of action would be "all of the above".  However, historically the U.S. government has rarely used the direct approach that seems to be very effective, namely the Conditional Cash Transfers, where money is given directly to families with a contractual obligation to engage in certain progressive behaviours, generally school attendance for *all* children and health checks.  Instead as discussed in [[discussion-dimension-1-procedures][Subsection 5.2.2]] the federal treasury would fund entities, new or already existing such as school to provide extra services (Title I of ESEA).

As expected, often the political discourse contains praises for these governmental interventions such as in the following statement by Richard W. Riley, Secretary of Education under President Clinton

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Title I Grants to Local Educational Agencies (LEAs) is the key Federal vehicle for closing the rich-poor gap in reading and math achievement. The recent National Assessment of Title I concluded that trends in the performance of the Nation's highest-poverty schools, as well as the progress of the lowest-achieving students, shows positive gains in reading and math since the 1994 reauthorization of Title I. The Administration has requested $8 billion for Title I Grants to LEAs in fiscal year 2000 and would provide additional funds to the highest-poverty schools by allocating a significant proportion of the request through the Targeted Grants formula. (106hhrg59654, 1999-09-23, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-106hhrg59654})
#+END_QUOTE

Later in the same statement are references to accountability, state academic standards, measurement of the performance of students, teachers, schools and school districts.  Secretary Riley mentions the "moral and fiscal dimension to being more accountable" and "strong corrective action".  All these concepts will reappear in NCLB and this law had very strong bipartisan support.

# AGs + poverty + prosperity
In September 2002 the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions organized a hearing titled "Successful Implementation of Title I: State and Local Perspectives" (107shrg81758, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-107shrg81758}).  Among the witnesses was William J. Moloney, Colorado Commissioner of Education who quoted from a statement by the Colorado Coalition to Close the Achievement Gap

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
If our American democracy is to endure and prosper, it cannot be as a society that tolerates two systems of education -- one of high expectation for the children of the fortunate and one of lesser standards for children of poverty and color ....

Perhaps for some there is no crisis in education, but for our most vulnerable children, it is more than a crisis: It is a State of national emergency.
 
We commit to this challenge, not just because it is the right thing to do, but because it is nothing less than a moral imperative.

*** COMP Form of Knowledge					     :subsec:
#<<discussion-dim-1-knowledge>>
According to the first of the three definitions of /governmentality/, the major form of knowledge is "political economy" \cite[p. 108]{Foucault:2009a}.  What does Michel Foucault mean with this expression?   Foucault discussed the term "political economy" in several of his lectures in 1978 and I will try to give my understanding of this subject.

First of all, population is the 'mediator' is the wealth of a nation.  The wealth of a nation is not just simply the sum of the value of the ore in its mines, the fields and the cattle, the factories, and the precious metals in its vaults.  The population is more than a consumer of wealth, it also *produces wealth*.

Secondly, the focus government is not the mere exercise of authority, the imposition of laws and regulations to ensure a peaceful and safe life for its people.  No, it has to go beyond that.  An effective government has to intervene in the economy of its country. Policy and economy merge into "political economy" to ensure a prosperous population and a strong nation.  There is no contrast between even libertarians and liberals.  In one case the government has to intervene to ensure free and transparent markets, the enforcement of business and civil contracts, and break up monopolies and cartels.  In the other case government has to ensure a minimum standard of living through several types social programs.  In both cases there is no 'hands-off' government, but rather a very involved and active one.  In other words, a government that creates /institutions/, employs /procedures/, makes /calculations/ and uses /tactics/ to enhance the wealth and security of its /population/.  A "real" government is an "economic" government.  The right to rule is not grounded on a dynastic or divine basis anymore, it is based on the capacity to maintain and increase the wealth and security of the population.

Based on the above reflections I would like to examine some relevant excerpts from the Presidential documents and Congressional hearings.  As we have just seen, one of the functions of political economy is to match the needs of the employers with the skills of the potential employees.  In a free and transparent market a skill that is in demand will receive higher salaries and more people will be motivated to acquire the required skills until an equilibrium is reached.  The duty of the government is to create and maintain an environment in which schools are capable of offering learning services to future employees.  This means having /procedures/ in place for school accreditation and teacher certification, which are /apparatuses of security/ and will be discussed in the next subsection.

However, once the /administrative state/ has established a public school system the economic policy interventions have to be multiplied and become more and more pervasive due to the actions and reactions of the agents acting in this system.  In reference to the achievement gaps both presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama have commented on the mismatch between offer and demand of work in the high tech area, an area that is vital for economic prosperity (Figure \ref{fig:pres-docs-cid-13-15-17}).  See for example the following by President William Clinton regarding the results of a study done by the Presidential Council of Economic Advisers on Hispanic students

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The study shows that Hispanics, who represent 11 percent of our work force, hold down just 4 percent of the jobs in information technology, jobs that pay much more than average in the area where jobs are growing most rapidly. Every American should be concerned about that gap. When the fastest growing demographic group in our country is underrepresented in the fastest growing employment sector, it means less opportunity and a violation of the values that we all share. It also means that, sooner or later, our economy will have a shortage of highly skilled workers where we really need them. (WCPD-2000-06-19-Pg1366-4, 2000-01-15, Table \ref{tbl:docs-clinton})

The above statement was made about two months before the beginning of the deflation of the Dot-Com Bubble.  The following quote by President George Bush reflects far worse an economic climate

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We must confront the scandal of illiteracy in America, seen most clearly in high-poverty schools where nearly 70 percent of fourth graders are unable to read at a basic level. We must address the low standing of America test scores amongst industrialized nations in math and science, the very subjects most likely to affect our future competitiveness. We must focus the spending of Federal tax dollars on things that work. Too often, we have spent without regard for results, without judging success or failure from year to year.

We can notice the shift from "schools are not doing enough" to "schools are not doing their job".  Christopher J. Dodd, Democratic Senator from Connecticut and member of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions said in 2002-05-23

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
According to a recent report from the Alliance for Excellence in Education, if African Americans and Hispanic Americans went to college at the same rate that whites do in this country, our gross domestic product would increase by $231 billion, and our tax revenues would increase by some $80 billion. Obviously, that is not going to happen without equal educational opportunity in our K through 12 schools. (107shrg79941, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-107shrg79941})
#+END_QUOTE

The title of this hearing was "America's schools: Providing equal opportunity or still separate and unequal?"  There is clear and intended reference to "Brown versus Board of Education."  However once one reads the statements in this hearing we can see that the reference to economic is not understood within the framework of "political economy."  It is placed in simpler conceptual structure where one underlines the supposed positive effects of educational achievement, and thus requests more public financing for a schools in general or specific educational programs.

The following quote by the president has a more positive outlook than his previous one.  First of all the economy has recovered from the previous economic crises and the following one is still several years away.  The second reason is rhetorical.  A politician has to proclaim "doom and gloom" to justify the implementation of new legislation that supposedly reforms an adverse situation.  After the reform has been implemented the tone of the political discourse has to reflect hope and optimism with a hint of praise.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
And we're making progress all across America. We're closing an achievement gap in this country. But there's more work to be done. We want to make sure high school diplomas mean something. We want to make sure we have strong math and science in our classrooms so our children can compete in the 21st century. We want to make sure we've got Internet in our classrooms so we can bring the latest education to help every child in America. What I'm telling you is, after 4 more years a rising generation will have more confidence and more skills to be able to realize the great promise of our country. (WCPD-2004-08-23-Pg1631, 2004-08-17)

The public education system in the U.S.A. is so complex that one can always appeal to some statistics to support just about any contention.  For instance, because federal, state and local education policy intersect each other in complex ways it very difficult to determine whether the narrowing of a certain AG is due to a federal , state, or local intervention (ref??).

We should also note that the federal government has taken to be among its responsibilities that the public education system not only be operated according to principles of civil rights or justice, but now also according not the principles of political economy.  Se for instance the following quote also by President Bush

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The gap -- in that the gap is closing all across the country is really good news for the future. We've got to make sure every child from every background, every part of America, gains the basic skills necessary to become employable in the 21st century, which means I think we need to expand the high standards and accountability of No Child Left Behind to our public high schools so that the high school diploma means something.  When you graduate, it means you can -- means you're employable, or it means you can go to a community college, or it means you go to higher education. That's what we ought to be doing. This country ought to maintain high standards and strong accountability to make sure we have economic security in the future. (WCPD-2005-06-27-Pg1043, 2005-06-22)
#+END_QUOTE

In the following excerpt from a speech by President Bush at the Economic Club in Chicago we can notice how the federal governments takes on more and more responsibilities.  That is, in the original version of NCLB the emphasis of interventions was on the primary schools.  Now, the federal government intends to extend it to secondary school.  The justification is placed within the conceptual framework of political economy

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We've got a problem in our high schools. We're beginning to make progress at the elementary school level--over the 5 years, the test scores have risen. But we've got a problem in our high schools. Our high school American students rank below students from around the world when it comes to math and science. We measure fine in junior high grades, but for some reason, between junior high and high school, our kids are falling behind. And that's a problem. If we want to be competitive and if we want our children to be able to fill the jobs of the 21st century, we must do a better job in high school. (WCPD-2006-01-09-Pg12, 2006-01-06)
#+END_QUOTE

The same opinion was expressed the following year by Bob Wise, President of the Alliance for Excellent Education and Former Governor of the State of West Virginia

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The time is right for the federal government to take bold leadership in advancing secondary school reform -- leadership that is appropriate to the crisis and in line with the federal government's tradition of intervening to assure the security of the nation, reduce poverty and increase equity, and advance research to inform effective practice. The increasing urgency to address the trouble plaguing secondary schools has been bolstered by an avalanche of reports recognizing the link between improving secondary education and increasing and maintain competitiveness. Such reports include ETS's The Perfect Storm and National Council on Economic Education's Tough Choices -- Tough Times. (110hhrg34631, 2007-04-23, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-110hhrg34631})

Bob Wise made a similar statement the following day at a hearing by the Senate Committee on Health Education, Labor, and Pensions

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
By appropriately extending its education focus to include the needs of students in middle and high schools, the Federal Government can move the Nation from 'no child left behind' to 'every child a graduate.' (110shrg35072, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-110shrg35072})
#+END_QUOTE

At a hearing by the House Science Committee the following was said by Representative Jerry F. Costello (Democrat, Illinois)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Most recently, the National Academy of Sciences' report Rising Above the Gathering Storm pointed to the relatively poor performance of U.S. students in math and science as a threat to the Nation's long-term economic health. Numerous reports in recent years, including the Academy report, have called for renewed efforts to improve K-12 education, particularly by attracting top students into teaching.  Further, studies suggest the need to improve the training of both current and future teachers to enrich their understanding of the math and science curriculum. As a senior Member of the Science Committee, I have supported increased funding for federal K-12 math and science education efforts to ensure that our students -- the future scientists, technologists, engineers, mathematicians, workers, and others responsible for our nation's future innovations, our national security, our economy, and our quality of life-receive a world class education in the sciences and mathematics. (109hhrg26798, 2006-03-30, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-109hhrg26798})
#+END_QUOTE

The above quote by Representative Costello is an example of how educational policy discourse is a crossroads of several lines of interest and pursuit.  The representative believes that is it important for the U.S. economy to attract 'top students into teaching' and 'improve the training of ... teachers to enrich their understanding of the math and science curriculum.'  Thus, according to him the federal government should be involved in teacher training, professional development, and recruitment.

Here below are two more quotes from President Bush that illustrate the connection made between policy, economy, and education

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
You know, one of the real problems we have in America is an achievement gap. I guess that's a fancy word for saying that, generally, Anglo kids are doing better in the basics than African American or Latino kids. And that's not good for this country, and it's not right.  And it seems like to me, we've got to focus our efforts and energies on solving that problem if we want this country to be a hopeful country with a strong economy. (WCPD-2007-07-30-Pg1011, 2007-06-26)

There is a growing consensus across the country that now is not the time to water down standards or to roll back accountability. There is a growing consensus that includes leaders of the business communities across America who see an increasingly global economy and, therefore, believe in standards and accountability. There's a growing consensus amongst leaders of civil rights organizations, like La Raza, and the Urban League, and the Education Equality Project. These leaders refuse to accept what I have called the soft bigotry of low expectations.  There's a growing consensus -- includes a lot of parents, and superintendents, and mayors, and Governors who insist that we put our children first. (WCPD-2009-01-12-Pg22-3, 2009-01-08)
#+END_QUOTE

This type of language is also expressed in congress.  For example Kati Haycock, Director of The Education Trust said in 2006-07-27 when concluding her statement

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Strong accountability is the most important leverage we have to focus public education on continuous improvement and the quest for equal educational opportunity. The consequences of weakening accountability will reverberate in the nation's military preparedness, economic vitality, and social cohesion. (109hhrg28839, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-109hhrg28839})
#+END_QUOTE

School accountability is certainly one of the central points of NCLB.  However, there are discordant voices that claim that the reform is not the best economic policy such as 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The term "achievement gaps" has become synonymous with differences in scores on standardized tests between groups of students.  And, given the poor quality of tests across the country, those test scores reflect little more than a student's ability to regurgitate facts. If we are truly committed to preparing our children to compete in the 21st century economy and world, we need to develop and assess a broader set of knowledge and skills. (110hhrg34417, 2007-04-12,  Steve Burroughs, National Education Association, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-110hhrg34417})
#+END_QUOTE

The National Education Association is the largest professional organization in the U.S.A. and a supporter of the Democratic Party.  In other words, it can afford expressing a critique even though it has to do so in nuanced terms (note the vague term 'broader') because NCLB was a bi-partisan legislation and many social action organization supported it.

# President Obama
The discourse of the following president, Barack Obama, on the subject is only slightly different, there is no close reference to accountability and possibly more emphasis is placed on employment and competition.  See for instance the following quotes and especially the last one

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
American prosperity has long rested on how well we educate our children. But this has never been more true than it is today. In the 21st century, when countries that outeducate us today will outcompete us tomorrow, there is nothing that will determine the quality of our future as a nation and the lives our children will lead more than the kind of education that we provide them. Nothing is more important. (DCPD-200900884, 2009-11-04, Table \ref{tbl:docs-obama})

As I said before, there are any number of actions we can take as a nation to enhance our competitiveness and secure a better future for our people, but few of them will make as much of a difference as improving the way we educate our sons and daughters. Offering our children an outstanding education is one of our most fundamental perhaps our most fundamental obligation as a country. And whether we meet that obligation not only reflects who we are as Americans, it will shape our future as a nation. Countries that outeducate us today will outcompete us tomorrow, and I refuse to let that happen on my watch. (DCPD-201000036, 2010-01-19)

We're not doing this because these schools well, we're not only doing this because these schools are a gateway to a better future for African Americans; we're doing it because their success is vital to a better future for all Americans. We know that Americans with college degrees far out-earn those without. We know that our businesses too often can't find qualified candidates for open positions. We know that other countries are out-educating their kids to out-compete ours. And yet, year after year, a stubborn gap persists between how well African Americans are doing compared to their white classmates. Year after year, American students trail their foreign peers in too many areas. And year after year, those students who do make it to college often find themselves unprepared for its rigours. (DCPD-201000130, 2010-02-26)

It's an economic issue when the unemployment rate for folks who've never gone to college is almost double what it is for those who have gone to college. It's an economic issue when 8 in 10 new jobs will require workforce training or a higher education by the end of this decade. It's an economic issue when countries that outeducate us today are going to outcompete us tomorrow. (DCPD-201000636, 2010-07-29)
#+END_QUOTE

The opinion of President Obama on this subjects are share shared by America's Promise Alliance (http://www.americaspromise.org).  The then president and CEO, Marguerite Kondracke said that "When President Obama and Secretary Duncan say that a long-term, sustainable economic recovery is only possible if we strengthen our education system, they are precisely correct." (111hhrg49499, 2009-05-12, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-111hhrg49499})   The subject of the House hearing was the high school dropout situation.  The dropout rates among groups of students mirror the achievement gaps.

Figures \ref{fig:pres-docs-cid-29-30-32} and \ref{fig:congr-hearings-cid-29-30-32} give an idea of the relevance of concepts related to career, graduation and college enrolment of the students in the two document collections.  We notice that the graduation rate of the students becomes more important in the later years as the attention of NCLB and the political discourse shifts from primary to secondary education.  The code associated with the career and employment of the students ranks number 12 in the Presidential documents (Table \ref{tbl:pres-docs-number-codings} and number 15 in the Congressional hearings (Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-number-codings}).  The ranking as occurrence per number of documents has similar ranking.  The cross-code tables (\ref{tbl:pres-docs-cross-code} and \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-cross-code}) show that the careers, graduation, and college enrolment of the student are highly related concepts.  The term 'college' (unstemmed) ranks 36th most frequent of the high content words and the term 'colleg' (stemmed) ranks 43th in the Presidential documents (Table \ref{tbl:pres-docs-freq-terms}).  The term 'college' (stemmed) ranks 37 in the Congressional hearings (Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-freq-terms}) and the term 'colleg' does not appear among the top 50 terms.  The dendrogram shown in Figure \ref{fig:pres-docs-dic-economi} show a close correlation of the terms 'diploma' and 'earn' and 'degree' with 'economi'.  The dendrogram in Figure \ref{fig:pres-docs-dic-compet} shows a close correlation between 'compet', 'diploma', and 'global'.  The dendrogram of the most frequent terms (Figure \ref{fig:pres-docs-freq}) shows a close association between 'colleg', 'scienc', and 'job' and a somewhat less association with 'centuri' and 'twentyfirst'.

*** COMP Apparatuses of Security				     :subsec:
#<<discussion-dim-1-apparatuses>>
# mention in "Analyses & Reflection" that ESEA/NBLC are an apparatus of security
# pp. 6, 11, 21, 30, 34, 37, 45, 46-47, 48-49, 59-60, 64, 379, 388

Michel Foucault often discusses what he means with /apparatuses of security/ (AoS).  He distinguishes them from 'discipline' by three considerations: (1) The AoS insert the phenomenon to be avoided within as series of probable events. (2) The reactions of power to this phenomenon are inserted in a calculation of cost. (3) Instead of a binary division between the permitted and the prohibited, one establishes an average considered as optimal on the one hand, and, on the other, a band with of the acceptable that must not be exceeded. \cite[p. 6]{Foucault:2009a}

Foucault identified four general features of the AoS: (1) The spaces of security. (2) The treatment of the uncertain, the aleatory. (3) Form of normalization specific to security and different from disciplinary norming.  (4) Correlation between the techniques of security and population as both the object and subject of the AoS (p. 11).

Then Foucault proceeds to discuss each of the four general features and here below I give excerpts from the book and my understanding.  Michel Foucault gives a series of related definitions

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Sovereignty is exercised within the borders of a territory, discipline is exercised on the bodies of individuals, and security is exercised over a whole population. (p. 11)
#+END_QUOTE

The issue of scarcity and risk is discussed later (p. 30ff).  Scarcity is an event to avoid by the government because it creates social unrest.  Foucault discusses how the governments have tried to prevent scarcity, originally regarding food i.e. wheat, through meticulous controls on production and sales.  Later economic policy thought intended to use the 'natural' mechanisms of the market to mitigate these adverse events.  Thus the AoS is not longer a juridical-disciplinary system but a natural-market based system (see pp. 36-37).  There is an understanding that all phenomena of scarcity were aberrations, the consequence of faulty and misguided economic policy.  A sound one would make the problem disappear, or more correctly be reduced to manageable dimensions.  We see the notions of self-regulation and /laisser-faire/.  A consequence of this state of policy is that is is applied to a /population/ not the set of all individuals.  There is a large difference, that is, there is a recognition that these mechanisms of self-regulation, these AoS do not ensure that each and every individual will never experience 'scarcity', rather that the population as statistically considered (/calculated/) on average and withing an acceptable range of variability will not experience scarcity.  (pp. 39-41)  I will later return to this point because it is obvious that NLCB in part intends to operate as an AoS but in other parts, see the title itself, it does not.

Foucault considers discipline centripetal, it concentrates, focuses, and encloses.  It circumscribes a space in which it power and the mechanisms of its power will function fully and without limit.   On the contrary, AoS are centripetal, they have a constant tendency to expand.  New elements are constantly being integrated.  Another difference is that discipline regulates everything.  The AoS let 'things happen' even though it is not 'hands off'.  (pp. 44-45)

A disciplinary system prescribes and prohibits, an AoS regulates, manages behaviour, eliminates the excesses and steers behaviour according to a goal by using 'natural-market' mechanisms (see pp. 45-47).

I would like now to examine some aspects of federal education policy on the achievement gaps in the light of my brief description and analysis of the /apparatuses of security/.  I intend to discuss two aspects of national education legislation, one where I see a discordance and one where I see and agreement for these apparatuses.   I would like to start with the discordance.

We have just seen how the AoS work with the "law of large numbers" not meant in the strict statistical sense, but as stating that reasonable governmental intervention should only look at the big picture.  For instance one could say the average plus or minus one or two standard deviations and thus cover approximately 95% of the population.  Interesting how the Foucaultian understanding of population is close to the statistical one in this regard.  Once we want to cover more of the population, let's say go from two to three or more standard deviations the cost (note /calculation/) becomes to high, as long as the tendency is in the direction of the governmental goal.

ESEA in its original form worked in this fashion.  Please refer to [[discussion-dim-1-procedures][Subsection 5.2.2]] (page \pageref{discussion-dim-1-procedures}) where I reproduced the "Declaration of Policy" of ESEA 1965.  The target is the student body segment of "children of low-income families."  The law provides a funding stream to local education agencies (LEAs) with a certain concentration of low-income families according to /calculations/ that will become more and more complex as time goes on as we have seen (subsection ref?).  The law intends to increase opportunity available to all, but does not control or compel the LEAs to intervene on each and every one of them, or even expect a certain result from all and each student as NCLB would later impose.

On 23 January 1997 at a hearing of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Representative Maxine Waters (Democrat, California) said the following at the conclusion of her statement

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I hope you will agree that the education of our children is one of if not the top priority. If we fail to prepare our children for the future, we will reap the whirlwind of their frustrated dreams.  We just understand and incorporate the full context of the educational crisis in America to fully appreciate the recent actions of the Oakland School Board, as well as their strength and resolve. I believe with this perspective we can all move forward together, striving to attain the goal of equal educational opportunity for all American children. (105shrg39641, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-105shrg39641})
#+END_QUOTE

Notice the *all American children* and a not too veiled allusion to the possibility of racial unrest.  During the same hearing Alan F. Clayton, Director of Equal Employment Opportunity (see Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-orgs}), said "Our schools are failing most poor children -- of all colors and backgrounds."

We notice that the first step toward including *all* students is through standards (Figure \ref{fig:pres-docs-cid-10}).  See for example in this same Senate hearing

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Our priority in California education is to raise standards for every student. This means keeping the focus on making sure every student is proficient in standard English. While I share the concerns of many parents, educators, and community members about the unacceptably low academic achievement levels of African-American students of the Oakland Unified School District and other school districts in California, I also believe it is a disservice to African-American students to set lower standards for their achievement. My department and I are committed to high academic standards and English proficiency for all students. Separate and equal education is inherently unequal. (Delaine Eastin, California State Superintendent of Public Instruction)
#+END_QUOTE

Here the term is *every student* and there is an allusion to "Brown versus Board of Education."  The president during this period, William Clinton, expressed a similar opinion two years later on 31 May 1999

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Based on high standards for all students, high-quality professional development for teachers, safe and disciplined learning environments, and accountability to parents and taxpayers, the Educational Excellence for All Children Act of 1999 provides a solid foundation for raising student achievement and narrowing the achievement gap between disadvantaged students and their more advantaged peers. More important, it will help prepare all of our children, and thus the Nation, for the challenges of the 21st century. I urge the Congress to take prompt and favorable action on this proposal. (WCPD-1999-05-31-Pg964, Table \ref{tbl:docs-clinton})
#+END_QUOTE

An almost synonymous expression for academic (high) standards is "(high) expectations" (Figure \ref{fig:pres-docs-cid-31}).  President Clinton used this language in 2000

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The first step to closing that gap is to believe, as I do, that high expectations are for all students. (WCPD-2000-06-19-Pg1366-4, 2000-01-15)
#+END_QUOTE

The above quotes show clearly that we are not operating according to the principles of governmentality and that the All Children Act of 1999, a failed proposal but almost completely reborn as NCLB, is not really an /apparatus of security/, but is closer to a /regime of discipline/.  Why is educational policy not creating /apparatuses of security/?  I suppose the fact that according to the US legislative framework children, and thus students, have at best only partial agency, and, as we have noticed previously, appeals to their 'natural' desires would not result in academic achievement as commonly understood.  There have been a few local programs where cash incentives were given to students, which, even though apparently effective, have not proliferated.  In kindergarten and the first grades teachers have a /practice/ of symbolic and verbal rewards, but its efficacy vanishes in later school grades.  As we will see, NCLB makes appeal to the 'natural desires' of the parents (Figure \ref{fig:congr-hearings-cid-18}) and later on RTTT will do so for the teachers (Figure \ref{fig:congr-hearings-cid-34}).  It is worth reflecting on the fact that Foucault considers the government through a /regime of discipline/ more primitive and scarcely effective, especially in a modern, complex, and technologically advanced society.

The intent of a universal standard is not necessarily universal achievement.  After all, standards could be interpreted as an ideal goal, similarly to 'full employment', 'no crime', 'zero inflation', 'zero newborn mortality', 'universal literacy', 'no poverty', and so on.  However, we all know that the real world can at best approximate the ideals and we are usually content with getting close to the ideal or making progress towards it.  However, strangely this did not happen in federal education policy.  NCLB legislated instead that the ideal should be attained by 2014 and punishment was to be administered otherwise.  In addition all Title I schools were obliged to show Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) even from the start.  See for instance the following quote by President George Bush

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We stand for equal opportunity. It's one of the ideals we believe in, in America. And equal opportunity demands schools that are effective and excellent. We must give all our children, every single child in America, the basics of knowledge and character, and we must leave no child behind. (WCPD-2002-04-08-Pg551-2, 2002-04-02, Table \ref{tbl:docs-bush})
#+END_QUOTE

Two years later on the re-election campaign trail the president would often speak about standards and achievement.  However, his language was more measured, he simply would say that he believed "that every child can learn" (see WCPD-2004-09-13-Pg1819, WCPD-2004-09-13-Pg1851, WCPD-2004-09-20-Pg2025, WCPD-2004-10-18-Pg2312, WCPD-2004-10-18-Pg2344, WCPD-2004-11-01-Pg2660, WCPD-2004-11-01-Pg2679, WCPD-2004-11-08-Pg2708).  He also used the expression "will not let any child get behind in America" or a close variation thereof (WCPD-2004-10-18-Pg2312, WCPD-2004-10-18-Pg2399, WCPD-2004-10-18-Pg2405, WCPD-2004-10-25-Pg2425, WCPD-2004-11-01-Pg2549, WCPD-2004-11-01-Pg2555, WCPD-2004-11-01-Pg2561, WCPD-2004-11-01-Pg2567, WCPD-2004-11-01-Pg2628, WCPD-2004-11-01-Pg2679, and WCPD-2005-03-21-Pg440, see Table \ref{tbl:docs-bush} and Figure \ref{fig:pres-docs-cid-27}).

Those are relatively vague and uplifting statements that almost any one would agree with.  Probably that is the reason he used those expressions during an electoral period.  After all appealing to a as wide as possible section of the electorate is a sound campaign strategy.  In later speeches President Bush would state that the law was working and the AGs were closing and there was no arguing with success.

His successor, President Barack Obama, expresses himself on the subject in a very similar fashion.  For example 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
But even if we do all of those things, America will not succeed in the 21st century unless we do a far better job of educating our sons and daughters, unless every child is performing the way Matthew [a model student] is performing. In an economy where knowledge is the most valuable commodity a person and a country have to offer, the best jobs will go to the best educated, whether they live in the United States or India or China. (DCPD-200900595, 2009-07-24, Table \ref{tbl:docs-obama})

So yes, we've still got more work to do here at this school to close the achievement gap. I think Dr. Word would agree with that. We've got to make sure that every student is on track. (DCPD-201100172, 2011-03-14)
#+END_QUOTE

Why do we have this type of Manichean language by the presidents?  There is a relatively long tradition of U.S. presidents that have declared "war" on several real or perceived dangers to society, such as poverty, drugs, and terrorism.  All have at best a mixed track record, but provide a fertile source for political rhetoric as well as ample government funding and employment.  Probably it would be considered unpatriotic or callous or reckless by a president to aim for anything less than complete success, at least on a discourse level.  The achievement gap has been placed by NCLB in this same type of polemical discourse.  We have thus drifted away from the /apparatuses of security/ to a /regime of discipline/ except for the war on poverty that has mostly disappeared from the public discourse.  The wars on drugs and terrorism have created very complex and costly disciplinary structures and the fight to eliminate the achievement gaps has finally developed into a structure where disciplinary actions against school first (NCLB) and teachers later (RTTT) have been implemented.  We will now examine the discourse in Congress on universal achievement (see Figure \ref{fig:congr-hearings-cid-27}).

Soon after the enactment of NCLB the then Secretary of Education, Dr. Roderick Page, said the following during a Senate Appropriations hearing

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The Department is committed to recognizing schools that make significant progress in closing achievement gaps and in ensuring that all children learn to high standards. (107shrg78480, 2002-03-07, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-107shrg78480})
#+END_QUOTE

A couple months (2002-05-23) later the discourse shifts from 'recognition' of schools to 'accountability' of schools in the opening statement of Senator Christopher J. Dodd (Democrat, Connecticut)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Last year, Democrats and Republicans worked very closely with the President to pass the ``No Child Left Behind Act,'' to hold schools accountable for closing the achievement gap for low-income students, minority students, limited English-proficient students, and students with disabilities, to hold schools accountable for all students performing at a very high level. (107shrg79941, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-107shrg79941})
#+END_QUOTE

The law is demanding that *all* student perform at a *very high* level.  During the same Senate hearing criticism is already expressed by Senator Edward Kennedy (Democrat, Massachusetts), but not about the law itself, but rather its funding.  The senator was a co-sponsor of the law and could thus not criticize it directly.  However, the implications of any law that requires a *complete* resolution of a social problem is the requirement of large amounts of money.  Not necessarily a bad thing if it is directed towards a certain constituency that has historically supported one's political party.  Here is the excerpt

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The new education reform bill passed only months ago places substantial new demands on local schools, teachers, and students. Students will be tested on more challenging curricula and schools and teachers will be held accountable for results.  But schools cannot achieve high standards on low budgets. We have an obligation to match new education reforms with new resources, so that all children will have a fair chance at academic success, no matter what school they attend.
#+END_QUOTE

Criticism of the law itself would appear a few years later.  An example is the following statement by Leland Leonard, Director of the  Division of Dine' Education of the Navajo Nation

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The large gap in proflciency -- The goal of full proficiency within a 12-year period is far more realistic in schools where students are already testing at a high level of proficiency than in those where proficiency levels are very low. For example a school where 75 percent of the student body is already rated as proficient, may have a relatively easy time of achieving the small increments necessary to make AYP. A school that begins with 10 percent of its students rated as proficient will have to consistently make dramatic gains. Even exceptional progress may still not be enough to avoid being labeled as failing. (109shrg21951, 2005-06-16, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-109shrg21951})

However, the education of Native American children at the national level is a relatively minor issue.  Let us examine two excerpts from a long statement by Andres Henriquez of the Education Division of The Carnegie Corporation

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Many urban school systems have succeeded in improving student achievement in the elementary and middle school setting, but these gains are not sustained and, sometimes, are even offset by losses at the high school level. In most urban high schools, as many as half the students drop out before completing their studies. Even many graduates do not show adequate levels of academic achievement, with up to one-third of high school graduates requiring remedial coursework at the post-secondary level. These problems are compounded by the fact that groups of students with varying family incomes and different ethnic backgrounds are separated by wide gaps in academic achievement.

....

The current model for the American high school, which is obsolete, was not designed to educate all students to high levels of achievement, but rather to manage students by sifting and sorting them, with only a minority of students prepared for higher education. (109hhrg21648, 2005-06-09, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-109hhrg21648})
#+END_QUOTE

Thus more than three years after the implementation of NLCB and about 9 years away from full proficiency for all students the situation is still not promising.  Nonetheless during the following year in a statement by the House Committee on Education and the Workforce optimism was expressed

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Initial results show No Child Left Behind is working to improve student achievement and reduce the achievement gap between disadvantaged students and their more fortunate peers. Long-term trend data released last summer reveals significant improvements in overall student achievement, with noteworthy gains among minority students. And according to data presented to Congress by the Council of the Great City Schools, urban students have posted higher math and reading scores on state tests since No Child Left Behind was signed into law. (109hhrg27985, 2006-05-18, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-109hhrg27985})
#+END_QUOTE

Similar language was expressed by the Deputy Secretary of Education of the federal administration, Raymond Simon, during the following month at a House hearing

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I want to begin today by saying unequivocally that increasing accountability for students at all levels -- in the school, the school district, and the State -- is at the core of President Bush's No Child Left Behind reforms. In fact, NCLB was designed to shine a light on those students who have so often been left behind in our Nation's schools: African-American and Hispanic students, students with disabilities, students with limited English proficiency (LEP), and economically disadvantaged students. NCLB requires that these students be tested annually, that their scores be publicly reported, and that schools, districts, and States be held accountable for their academic performance. This is the only way to close achievement gaps between minority students and their peers and ensure that all students read and do math on grade level by 2014.

State accountability plans under NCLB reflect these goals, and use student assessment data in reading and mathematics to determine whether each district and school is making adequate yearly progress (AYP) toward the statutory requirement of 100 percent grade-level proficiency by 2014. A fundamental component of AYP is looking at assessment data disaggregated by various subgroups based on race, ethnicity, poverty, disability, and limited English proficiency. A school makes AYP only if each subgroup -- not just the overall student population -- meets annual proficiency objectives. (109hhrg28431, 2006-06-13, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-109hhrg28431})
#+END_QUOTE

It is interesting to note that according to the Committee on Education and the Workforce

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Today's hearing will address concerns that the test scores of some disadvantaged and minority students are not being disaggregated in school and district adequate yearly progress calculations under the No Child Left Behind Act.
#+END_QUOTE

In other words, the federal law was not strictly implemented in the periphery.  The LEAs and states are trying to blunt or lessen the stringent requirements of NLCB.  I understand this situation as a conflict between the /apparatuses of security/ that NCLB provides such as funding for accountability, requirements of measurements and teacher qualifications with the /regimes of discipline/ in which schools operate and this all exacerbated by the full proficiency by 2014 requirements for all students.  Indeed the next month another House hearing was held about another aspect of the AYP calculation.  That is, a request to a different type of calculation that would be more 'forgiving' for schools and to increase the number of schools that would meet AYP.  Several states wanted to move from a 'status model' to a 'growth model.'  Let us examine the following excerpt by Marlene S. Shaul, Director for Education, Workforce, and Income Security Issues of the U.S. Government Accountability Office

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: I am pleased to be here today to discuss our report, which describes how states use growth models to measure academic performance and how these models can measure progress toward achieving key goals of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLBA). With annual expenditures approaching $13 billion dollars for Title I alone, NCLBA represents the federal government's single largest investment in the education of the 48 million students who attend public schools. The NCLBA -- the most recent reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 -- requires states to improve academic performance so that all students are proficient by 2014 and achievement gaps among groups such as economically disadvantaged students close. The upcoming reauthorization of the law presents an opportunity to discuss some key issues associated with the act. (109hhrg28839, 2006-07-27, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-109hhrg28839})
#+END_QUOTE

The report was cautious and mostly descriptive.  No indication was given about the feasibility of reaching the main goal of NCLB.  With all these problems, why did such a law pass with so great a support in Congress and in the U.S. society at large?  I think that the following statement by Joel Klein, Chancellor of the New York Department of Education given at the same hearing explains very clearly the reason

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
For decades, school reformers have tried and failed to fix education in America, to ensure that American students do not fall behind their international peers and to ensure that all students in this country, no matter what their race or socio-economic status, are receiving the high-quality educations they deserve. The law that we're discussing today, No Child Left Behind, might not be perfect, but it is incredibly valuable because it recognizes that the achievement gap -- the gap that separates our African-American and Latino students from their white and Asian peers -- is the chief, though certainly not the only, problem in American schooling. When Congress passed NCLB, it helped America finally take responsibility for the fact that white and Asian students are performing four years ahead of African-American and Latino students in high school. Four years. And this law finally puts muscle behind the attempt to close that gap. It forces us to report student performance in grades three through eight by race. We can no longer mask the deficiencies of some students with outsized gains by others.
#+END_QUOTE

Phyllis McClure, Dianne Piche and William L. Taylor of the Citizens Commission on Civil Rights stated that "as a natural extension of the principles of Brown v. Board of Education, we have long endorsed a strong federal role to ensure that our nation's public school systems live up to our national demands for both equity and excellence." (109hhrg29626, 2006-08-28, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-109hhrg29626})

The following year (20070-03-13) at a joint hearing on the subject of the re-authorization of ESEA which had the telling title "Improving NCLB to close the Achievement Gap", Reg Weaver, president of the National Education Association, gave a very detailed and extensive presentation during which he said that 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
It [The law's AYP model] fails to recognize that all children can learn, but all children do not learn at the same rate. It fails to include fair, valid, and reliable measures for students with special needs, including students with disabilities and English Language Learners. It fails to differentiate between those schools that are truly struggling to close achievement gaps and those that fall short on only one of 37 federally mandated criteria. Finally, it fails to include a comprehensive set of measures for school quality and student learning, focusing only on one statewide standardized test in two subjects. (110jhrg33757, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-110jhrg33757})
#+END_QUOTE

We can perceive the tension between a /regime of discipline/ and an /apparatus of security/.  There are more signs that it may not be possible to attain full proficiency as NCLB prescribes

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Federal investment at the middle and high school level is not sufficient. The main source of Federal funds is through the title I program. Yet, only 8 percent of students who benefit from these funds are in high school. Ninety percent of high schools with very low graduation rates have very low-income students. But only a quarter of these schools receive title I funds. We need to dedicate more resources and support for secondary schools to improve academic achievement and ensure that every student has a fair opportunity to graduate. (Senator Edward Kennedy, 110shrg35072, 2007-04-24, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-110shrg35072})

Closing the achievement gap and ensuring that every student is proficient in reading requires an intense focus on literacy teaching and learning in the middle grades. (National Middle School Association, 110shrg35072)

On the other hand, the most serious flaw in this draft concerns the retention of an arbitrary accountability time line, that all students be proficient by 2014, along with a set of calibrated benchmarks. This uniform deadline assumes that the schools and districts furthest from the goal can make the most extraordinary gains. But the assumption directly contradicts what research tells us about the rates of improvement we can expect from the most successful districts. The goal of 100 percent proficiency in six more years will not be attained because all schools and districts would have to do something that has never been done in any district unless the standards were extremely low. The solution is straightforward -- set reasonable growth goals and hold schools and districts accountable for improving at a rate that research says is attainable. Specifically, the 100% proficiency requirement by 2014 undermines the credibility of the law, punishes rather than rewards many successful schools, and should be replaced by realistic growth targets based on the progress achieved in the quartile of districts making the most rapid progress in the state. This is consistent with the shift of attention to progress measures in the draft bill. Shifting the focus from the unattainable ideal to ambitious yet realistic goals would also help create conditions more likely to encourage highly qualified teachers and principals to stay in the schools that most seriously need them. (Daniel J. Losen, Civil Rights Project of UCLA, 110hhrg37638, 2007-09-10, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-110hhrg37638})

It is important that we have a thorough understanding of the prevalence and importance of the larger environmental factors in a student's life that influence their academic success. Unless we address these foundational issues, not even the best teachers with the highest quality curriculum will be able to ensure that every student graduates ready for college. (Marguerite Kondracke, America's Promise Alliance, 2009-05-12, 111hhrg49499, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-111hhrg49499})

We need to move away from punitive measures based on a single test on a single day, and toward recognizing and rewarding schools and teachers based on growth and progress. And we need to give states and districts much more flexibility, while focusing interventions where they are most needed.

# text mining and coding summaries
The stemmed term 'expect' that is derived from words such as the noun 'expectation' and the verb 'to expect' has a frequency rank of 16 in the Presidential documents (Table \ref{tbl:pres-docs-freq-terms}. These terms are usually associated with expectations of student achievement.  In the correlation plot for the most frequent terms in this document collection the term 'expect' is at the center of the terms 'believe', 'child', 'learn', 'result' and 'reform' (Figure \ref{fig:pres-docs-corr-freq}).  This is an indication of how the school policy ('reform') is closely related to the concepts of educational achievement expectations and the belief that high instead of low results can be obtained.  The same type of relationships between these terms are presented in the cluster dendrogram for the term 'reform' (Figure \ref{fig:pres-docs-dic-reform}) and 'standard' (Figure \ref{fig:pres-docs-dic-standard}) as well as the association tables (tables \ref{tbl:pres-docs-assoc-reform} and \ref{tbl:pres-docs-assoc-standard}) and the dendrogram of all most common terms (Figure \ref{fig:pres-docs-freq}).

# TeacherCert, TeacherQuality, TeacherReplace
A relatively simple /apparatus of security/ that has existed in the United States for quite some time is the certification of teachers.  The states have instituted it to guarantee that teachers have a minimum set of qualifications and preparation that is deemed appropriate for a particular state.  Any one who desired to teach in a public school is supposed to meet these requirements.  The passing of NCLB has placed teacher certification in the spotlight.  One of its provisions is that there should be in each classroom a "highly qualified teacher" (See figures \ref{fig:pres-docs-cid-36-38-39} and \ref{fig:congr-hearings-cid-36-38-39}.  This provision will be discussed more extensively in [[discussion-dim-3-federal-local][Subsection 5.4.2]]).  On the surface it is a very reasonable requirement.  If we want all students to have a comparable quality of education, we should make sure that all of them are instructed by qualified teachers.  The US public education system has a problem with a concentration in poorer schools of teachers that teach out-of-subject.  Due to the local nature of public education in the U.S.A., teacher salaries and work conditions vary greatly from school district to schools district, and often also between schools.  Teachers, as anyone else would, desire from their employment an as high as possible remuneration, as well as a pleasant work environment and professional status.

Thus, an /apparatus of security/ that operates according to Foucault in harmony with market forces and the natural desires of the population would have to be a system that would offer better pay and working conditions in less desirable schools.  Even a uniform pay across states would not be enough, it would actually have to be higher in 'difficult' schools than in desirable schools.  The system of decentralized financing of schools is not able to do so.  The federal or state governments would have to subsidize teacher salaries.  There are programs that do so.  However, they are not systematic and depend on inconsistent funding sources. 

As we have previously seen with the requirement that *all* students be proficient, also in this respect NCLB goes against the 'natural-market' forces and the desires of the teachers.  Such as situation will be remedied only by applying /procedures/ that operate according to the natural desires of the participants or otherwise implement a /disciplinary regime/.  As we will see here, the states have generally tried to evade or ignore this provision of the law as it is the most intractable aspect of the education system in the U.S. that is unequal by design and tradition.

In the following quotes from presidents and congressional hearings we will see a discussion of this problematic.  President Bush acknowledges the problem of in the following excerpt

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We'll emphasize math and science so our kids can fill the jobs of the 21st century. We'll reward teachers who gets results for their students. We'll give our best teachers incentives to teach in the neediest schools. (WCPD-2004-09-27, 2004-09-22, Table \ref{tbl:docs-bush})
#+END_QUOTE

Several months later he is more specific in this regard

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
And finally, I believe the Federal Government can put a program together to help reward success for our teachers. I proposed a new $500 million incentive fund to reward teachers who get results. Teachers could qualify for an award by raising student performance or closing the achievement gap or volunteering to teach in low-income schools. That will be up to the local districts, to decide how to disburse the money.  But I think it makes sense to encourage excellence by providing a $5,000 bonus to nearly 100,000 outstanding teachers across the country. The program won't be administered at the Federal level. It will be administered at the State and local level. But it's a way to help say to teachers, "Thanks for a job well done. Here's a little extra because of merit. Here's our way of saying thanks for doing what you want to do, which is provide excellence." (WCPD-2005-01-17-Pg45, 2005-01-12)
#+END_QUOTE

However, to equalize teaching quality among poor and wealthy schools much more than "a little extra" is needed.  A $5000 bonus for nearly 100,000 teachers in a large country as the U.S.A. is not even a drop in the bucket.  I think that it is a sign of the intractability of the problem that the president has to mention it, but can not anything about it is practical terms.  The following president, Barack Obama, would make similar remarks on this subject, an indication that after about 7 years of NCLB the problem has not been solved

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Now, it's time to start taking this commitment seriously. We've got to do a better job recruiting and preparing new teachers. We've got to do a better job of rewarding outstanding teachers. 

It means bringing quality teachers in it means bringing quality teachers to the neighborhoods that need them the most, because right now a lot of what happens is, is that some of the best teachers, as they get seniority, they move on to the places, the school districts that pay better and, frankly, are easier to teach in. And we've got to give them some incentives to stay so that the kids who need the most help are getting some of the best teachers. (DCPD-200900884, 2009-11-04, Table \ref{tbl:docs-obama})

So I want teachers to have higher salaries. I want them to have more support. I want them to be trained like the professionals they are, with rigorous residencies like the ones that doctors go through. I want to give them a career ladder so they've got opportunities to advance and earn real financial security. I don't want talented young people to say, I'd love to teach, but I can't afford it.

I want them to have a fulfilling and supportive workplace environment. I want them to have the resources, from basic supplies to reasonable class sizes, that help them succeed. (DCPD-201000636, 2010-07-29)

But what hasn't worked is denying teachers, schools, and States what they need to meet these goals. That's why we need to fix No Child Left Behind. We need to make sure we're graduating students who are ready for college and ready for careers. We need to put outstanding teachers in every classroom and give those teachers the pay and the support that they deserve. (DCPD-201100172, 2011-03-14)

Soon after the implementation of NLCB on 2002-01-08 Representative Chaka Fattah (Democrat, Pennsylvania) made the following remark at a Senate hearing

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Today, I am here as a sincere advocate for what I believe is missing, both in theory and in practice, from the approach taken in H.R. 1 [i.e. NCLB] to improving our public school system. To accomplish the goal of providing every student with a high quality education, we must act decisively to eliminate inequities that exist among public school systems within and among States. Therefore, I come here this morning, calling upon our Nation's leaders to make certain that all children, regardless of income level or place of residency, are provided adequate educational resources to become successful members of society. In order to accomplish such a fundamental feat, we must require that our Nation's public school systems provide all students seven essential elements for learning, which include: (a) instruction from a highly qualified teacher; (b) rigorous academic standards; (c) small class sizes; (d) up-to-date instructional materials; (e) state-of-the art libraries; (f) updated computers; (g) qualified guidance counselors. (107shrg79941, 2002-05-23, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-107shrg79941})
#+END_QUOTE

Actually, NCLB already requires elements (a) and (b) and the other points, besides possibly (c), have at best a minor effect on achievement.  Michael A. Rebell, Executive Director of the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, also participated in this hearing and said the following in regards to this subject

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Qualified and experienced teachers -- the most important resource in our public schools -- are in shortest supply in schools that serve our neediest children. School districts with low teacher salaries cannot recruit and retain qualified teachers, losing the best-qualified candidates to wealthier school districts that can pay higher salaries or to better-paying jobs in other sectors of the economy. Courts in several States have ruled that inequitable outcomes of public school students are strongly linked to high proportions of unqualified teachers -- measured in terms of lack of appropriate certifications, poor undergraduate preparation, low performance on teacher certification exams, and high teacher turnover -- in low-income urban and rural school districts.

In Arkansas, for instance, a court recently found that "... disparity ... in teachers' salaries ... are so great that they work to destabilize the education system by driving qualified teachers away from districts where they are most needed. Schools and school districts with more disadvantaged students need more qualified teachers per student. However, the schools with the highest number of disadvantaged students are typicaily the schools which have the lower teacher salaries."
#+END_QUOTE

A few months later Michael Casserly, Executive Director of the Council of the Great City Schools, stated at another Senate hearing

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Requiring, encouraging, or providing incentives for highly skilled administrators and teachers to transfer to low-performing schools may improve the stock of staff at those schools and help disadvantaged and minority children succeed.

The House Committee on Education and the Workforce organized a hearing on the subject of teacher quality in 2004-05-27.  During this hearing Dr. Lewis C. Solmon of the Milken Family Foundation stated

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Yet, despite the evidence that quality teachers are of utmost importance, until No Child Left Behind, ensuring a quality teacher for every student has not been a priority in the myriad attempts to improve public schools.

But we do not have enough high quality teachers, and there is a serious mal-distribution of the best. The best teachers usually want to teach where their job will be easiest, safest and most rewarding, that is, in schools with higher SES families. The most qualified teachers in the inner city are most likely to move when there is an opening in the suburbs. They rarely get any recognition, financial or otherwise, for staying with the more challenging situation. New teachers fill the vacancies in the in the poorest schools, spend their first few years trying to figure out what to do, and by the time they become effective teachers they move on, only to be replaced by other neophytes.  Meanwhile, the most advantaged children are assured a constant flow of the best teachers.

More importantly in the spirit of Brown, we must keep many of our best teachers in schools where they can help our most needy students. Significant extra compensation for those teaching in the poorest schools will help.

When the quality of teachers available to minority students is as high or higher than the quality of teachers available to whites, all children will have equal opportunities to learn, which was the real purpose of the Brown decision.

#+END_QUOTE

The following year, on 2005-09-29, a similar statement was made by Kati Haycock, Director of The Education Trust

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Despite knowing the importance of teacher quality, especially for students with little support for education outside of school, and despite all of the lofty language and public commitments to closing the achievement gap, we systematically assign our most vulnerable students to our least qualified, least experienced teachers. When there are shortages, poor and minority students get out-of-field teachers; as teachers accrue valuable experience, they often transfer into -- and are paid more to teach in -- the most affluent schools. So high-poverty and high-minority schools tend to have a harder time recruiting quality teachers, and then serve as a revolving door for the novice teachers they help train.

Unfortunately, the U.S. Department of Education has not actively implemented the teacher quality provisions. For the first two and half years after NCLB was enacted, the Department refused to exert any authority at all over the states' implementation.

What we are left with is a bold policy initiative from Congress that has never seen the light of day. Billions of dollars in new federal money have been poured into teacher quality initiatives with no federal oversight. This vacuum of federal action has allowed states to game the system, making compliant states look bad and conniving states look good. Most states have taken advantage of the Department's lax enforcement to report that almost all classes already are taught by highly qualified teachers, even in the highest poverty schools. This despite years of research about grave shortages in certain subjects, such as secondary math and science.

Even more disturbing has been inaction on the inequitable distribution of teacher talent. Congress required each state to develop a plan to measure and address the disproportionate assignment of unqualified, inexperienced, and out-of-field teachers to poor and minority students. The Department has never issued regulations or guidance detailing what those plans should include, nor have they ever asked states to produce such plans, or even reminded states of these obligations.

As we have discussed previously, provisions that counter natural human tendencies and desires, as well as deep-rooted traditions will face opposition.  The way that federal education reform intends to work is that the federal government through the U.S. Department of Education acts on the states and the states in turn direct the LEAs.  However, the states and LEAs have their own education policies, and rules and standards and the whole system is never properly aligned, not even considering the differing and opposing interests of the parties in this 3 tiered system.  With respect to removing the inequalities in teacher quality the only /tactic/ that would be effective is to have a uniform statewide employment compensation scheme (/calculation/).  However, I have not found in the documents that I have analyzed anything that goes beyond 'incentives', 'grants', 'awards', or 'encouragements' as well as 'options' and 'discretionary.'  See for example the following excerpts 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Recently, for the first time in the four-year history of NCLB's implementation, the U.S. Department of Education required states to develop equity plans to ensure poor and minority students get their fair share of teacher talent. And Congress has encouraged innovation in teacher assignment, evaluation, and compensation by creating the Teacher Incentive Fund. These are important steps, but raising teacher quality and ensuring equal access to effective teachers must remain a bipartisan priority. (Kati Haycock, Director, The Education Trust, 109hhrg28839, 2006-07-27, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-109hhrg28839})

Answer. The Administration is requesting $500 million for the Teacher Incentive Fund initiative to allow States and school districts to develop and implement innovative ways to provide financial incentives for teachers who raise student achievement and close the achievement gap in some of our Nation's highest-need schools, to attract highly qualified teachers to those schools, and to redesign teacher compensation systems in order to align pay with performance. (Margaret Spellings, 109shrg49104171, 2005-03-02, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-109shrg49104171})

Under the formula component of the initiative, the Department would provide grants to SEAs by a formula. States would use these funds to give monetary awards to: (1) teachers who raise student achievement or make significant progress in closing the achievement gap among groups of students; and (2) highly qualified teachers who agree to teach in high-need schools. (Margaret Spellings, 109shrg49104171)

Answer 7. Improving teacher quality for all students is essential to achieving the vision of No Child Left Behind. It is especially important to ensure poor and minority students are taught by effective teachers. I stand with President Bush in supporting the Teacher Incentive Fund, giving States extra resources to provide monetary incentives for high quality teachers to teach in the schools that need them the most and reward schools and teachers that are eliminating the achievement gap. (Margaret Spellings, 109shrg97751, 2005-01-06, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-109shrg97751})

It is long past the time to move on from the anachronistic single-salary schedules that treat teachers as if they are assembly line workers instead of professionals. Teachers who take on greater responsibility, and teachers who are more successful, should be able to distinguish themselves within the profession. Given that the most acute need for better teachers and experienced mentors is in high-poverty, Title I schools -- and that these schools have languished without appropriate assistance in recruiting and retaining the strongest faculty -- it is entirely appropriate for Congress to create these incentives for innovation. It is important to keep in mind that none of these incentive programs are mandatory; they simply are being made available to states and local districts that are ready to try something new to help their students succeed. If we are serious about closing the achievement gap, we cannot leave these strategies off the table. (Kati Haycock, President, the Education Trust, 110hhrg37638, 2007-09-10, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-110hhrg37638})

However, the suggestions for solving the teacher quality gap are more in line with a /disciplinary regime/.  See for instance

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In 2001, Congress recognized that the teacher quality gap was a major cause of the achievement gap when it debated and amended the ESEA. Significantly, Congress enacted provisions not only requiring that all teachers be ``highly qualified'' by this last school year, but also compelling both states and districts take immediate steps to close their teacher-quality gaps. (Dianne M. Piche, Executive Director, Citizens' Commission on Civil Rights, 109hhrg29626, 2006-08-28, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-109hhrg29626})

The Bush Administration has signaled its in tention to make a mid-course correction and, under Secretary Spellings, has begun to devote serious attention to NCLB's teacher quality provisions. Halfway through 2005, the Department finally began taking action to enforce the teacher quality provisions of the law, including the teacher equity provision that had been all but ignored in previous years. The Department's actions included publishing expanded policy guidance, signaling states that compliance with these provisions is required, and -- more controversially -- giving states that had made a ``good faith'' effort to comply with the law an extra year to meet the law's goals. (Phyllis McClure, Dianne Piche and William L. Taylor, 109hhrg29626)

The Department of Education should immediately publish the state plans submitted this week on its website, www.ed.gov. The Secretary and her staff should carefully evaluate the likely effectiveness of each state's plan detailing how they say they will address the teacher quality and equity provisions of the law during the upcoming year. (Dianne M. Piche, 109hhrg29626)

States are also required to establish measurable objectives for each LEA and school that, at a minimum, shall include an annual increase in the percentage of highly qualified teachers in each LEA and school to ensure that all teachers teaching in core academic subjects in each public elementary and secondary school are highly qualified not later than the end of the 2005-06 school year. (Phyllis McClure, Dianne Piche and William L. Taylor, 109hhrg29626)

Although States and school districts are making significant progress in meeting the HQT [highly qualified teacher] requirement, there is still a lot of work to do to ensure that each State can meet the goal that every child is taught by a highly qualified teacher by the end of the 2005-2006 school year. (Margaret Spellings, 109shrg27036, 2006-03-01, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-109shrg27036})

We will also be looking very carefully at States' efforts to report accurately HQT data this spring and summer when we review their progress in meeting the requirement that all teachers of core academic subjects be highly qualified by the end of the 2005-2006 school year.  After that review, we will likely require many States to submit revised State plans, and we may take corrective actions against any States that are not making a good-faith effort to improve their data collection and reporting. The Department also plans to begin a new round of State monitoring visits late this summer. (Margaret Spellings, 109shrg49104190, 2006-03-01, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-109shrg49104190})

It also enforces NCLB's teacher equity provisions by making ESEA funding contingent on states' compliance with their plans to make sure poor and minority children have equitable access to high-quality teachers. (George Miller, 110hhrg34990, 2007-05-11, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-110hhrg34990})

And by eliminating the so-called High Objective Uniform State Standard of Evaluation (HOUSSE) exception to the guarantee that all students be taught by a highly-qualified teacher, the draft closes a loophole that many states have used to avoid addressing the fact that many students -- disproportionately low-income and minority students -- are taught by teachers without sufficient training or content knowledge in their field. (Kevin Carey, Policy Manager, Education Sector, 110hhrg37638, 2007-09-10, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-110hhrg37638})

However, the law's strict and punitive nature has discouraged new teachers from entering the field and has made it difficult to retain quality teachers with advanced degrees.  Additionally, the focus on testing has been a great disservice to our children and populations of students are being left behind. (Phil Hare, Democratic Representative Illinois, 110jhrg33757, 2007-03-13, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-110jhrg33757})

Such teacher reforms began paying off early on. After Connecticut's $300 million 1986 initiative, for instance, the higher salaries and improved pay equity, combined with the tougher preparation and licensing standards and an end to emergency hiring, swiftly raised teacher quality. An analysis found, in fact, that within 3 years, the State not only had eliminated teacher shortages, even in cities, but also had created surpluses (Connecticut State Department of Education, 1990). Even as demand increased, the pool of qualified applicants remained solid. A National Education Goals Panel report (Baron, 1999) found that in districts with sharply improved achievement, educators cited the high quality of teachers and administrators as a critical reason for their gains and noted that ``when there is a teaching opening in a Connecticut elementary school, there are often several hundred applicants'' (p. 28). (Linda Darling-Hammond, Stanford University, 110shrg34052, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-110shrg34052})

The results of the text mining of the Presidential documents show an association between the term 'teacher' and the terms 'incent' (0.37), 'reward' (0.36), 'bonus' (0.29) and 'merit' (0.21, Table \ref{tbl:pres-docs-assoc-teacher}).  Other terms are also related to the incentives given to teachers, such as 'forgiv' (0.27) and 'loan' (0.22), which refer to student loan forgiveness for new teachers.  Other closely associated terms refer to teacher quality and certification, 'qualifi' (0.20) and 'certifi' (0.19).  Notice that the highest association is with the incentives instead of with the regulatory terms.

The congressional hearings present a somewhat different situation.  The term 'qualified' (unstemmed) ranks 46 in frequency (Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-freq-terms}).  The table of associations shows the inverse of the Presidential documents, in the sense that terms associated with regulatory terms are more closely associated to the term 'teacher' that terms that denote incentives (Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-assoc-teacher}).  To the first group belong 'qualifi' (0.48), 'high' (0.39), 'qualiti' (0.31), 'veteran' (0.25), 'certif' (0.24), 'subject' (0.23), 'experienc' (0.20), 'inexperienc' (0.20), 'requir' (0.19), 'certifi' (0.18), 'houss' (0.18), and 'uncertifi' (0.18).  Terms in the second group are 'salari' (0.23), 'attract' (0.22), 'recruit' (0.21), 'incent' (0.20), 'reward' (0.19), 'shortag' (0.18), and 'turnov' (0.17).  The stemmed term 'houss' derives from the acronym HOUSSE, "High, Objective, Uniform State Standard of Evaluation" (see page 11 of NCLB Toolkit for Teachers by the US Department of Education, http://www2.ed.gov/teachers/nclbguide/nclb-teachers-toolkit.pdf).

# this 2nd definition is more appropriately applicable at the government of a nation as a whole. However, I will try to perform some analysis and reflections ...


The second dimension of Foucault's definition of /governmentality/ refers to the tendency of the *government to become pre-eminent* over other forms of power.  This process is actualized by the formation of *governmental apparatuses* and the development of a "whole complex of savoirs" (see [[lit-review-governmentality][Section 2.4]], point 2 and \citeNP[p. 108]{Foucault:2009a}).

We discussed the forms of power (sovereignty, discipline and governmentality) in the previous section ([[discussion-dim-1][5.2]], and in more detail in [[discussion-dim-1-apparatuses][5.2.7]]).  We can note that in the United States the public schools have become an integral part of the government structures, initially at local-state level and now federal level.  The formation of governmental apparatuses will be discussed in the following section ([[discussion-dim-3][5.4]]).  The old disciplinary regime of the schools, a form of extension of the family regime of discipline, while still existing, is hidden under the accumulation of successive layers of /procedures/, /calculations/, and /tactics/.  Thus, here I would like to discuss the "complex of savoirs" as associated with the policy discourse on the achievement gaps and the tension between the governmental and sovereignty forms of power in the public school system.

Here is not the place to give an exposition of what Foucault means with "savoir."  However, I will give, based on the sources that I have consulted, a my understanding of the term.[fn:123]  First of all, the French term is translated into English as "knowledge" and is distinguished from "connaissance", a term that \citeA{Scheurich:2005a} denote as "formal knowledge."  The term "connaissance" indicates knowledge in its external, codified, objective form.  This form of knowledge is internalized, 'embodied' in the persons that apply it in their personal lives and through this practice in society at large with all its complex social interactions.  "Savoir" allows us to function as social beings.

A second aspect of the term is its connection to "pouvoir", power in English.  According to Michel Foucault these two terms are closely connected.  While modern society still partially operates according to fear and intimidation (e.g. the obedience of speed limits versus the imposition of traffic violation fines), a socially adjusted person is not supposed to operate this way.  We consider a person that does not steal or murder simply because of fear of the justice system at best a potential criminal and at worst a dangerous sociopath.  We all operate according to certain norms because we all 'know' that it is the proper way to live in society.  Similarly, we "know" that a just society we are all equal in front of the law, that each of use has the right to keep their property and live in peace.  This knowledge tells us what is acceptable or not and places us in a complex system of power relations.

The third and last aspect of knowledge-power is its change over time.  Foucault divides the history of the West into epochs and associates with each one of them a different understanding of the world and society with its own type of knowledge and power.  In this chapter I try to show how from the beginning of the policy data that I have collected on the AGs, its understanding has gradually shifted.

Returning to the second dimension of Foucault's /governmentality/ and in light of the above brief exposition of the concept of knowledge-power, I would to explore now the policy discourse on the AGs.

First of all is the predominant power structure of the schools the government instead of sovereignty or discipline?  Unlike Europe where schools were instituted by the churches first and national governments later the schools in the U.S.A. were instituted, funded, and controlled by local families.  It was almost an extension of the family model and the school teachers and principals derived their authority (sovereignty) directly from the families and the students were expected to be disciplined as children in a family would be \cite<see>[p. 107]{Foucault:2009a}.

It is thus this local and family based structure of the public school in the U.S.A. that contains the germ of the achievement gaps.  There is no equalizing force within the state and even less at a national level that could create a uniform school environment.  No one then would have considered this situation anything but the normal variability existing in society.  Just as it was accepted and understood that there were differences in income and property there were differences in educational achievement.  In the absence of statewide or even national curricula and assessments there were no /tactics/ and /calculations/ to even become aware of the situation.  In other words, no one would have called it a "gap."  The introduction in the public discourse of the term "gap" is the result and cause of the problematization of the differences in academic achievement.

In the following section ([[discussion-dim-3][5.4]]) I describe more fully how the public school system becomes progressively more and more administratively complex.  Here I would like to point out that the discourse on the AGs could have only emerged in a governmental environment and could not have arisen in any other sort of power structure.  Only as far as the schools are integrated into the administrative state and become in incremental steps controlled by government apparatuses and subject to the laws and regulations of the states and of the nation is the discourse on the AGs possible and intelligible.

# discipline versus governmental control
The earliest reference to the AGs in my sources is dated 1997-01-23 (105shrg39641, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-105shrg39641}, Figure \ref{fig:congr-hearings-cid-6}).  During this Senate hearing Orlando L. Taylor, Dean at Howard University (a HCBU in Washington, DC), said

Mr. Chairman and Distinguished Members of the Subcommittee: Let me begin by thanking you for having the foresight to schedule a special hearing on language issues and academic underachievement of many of our nation's African-American children. I am honored to have been invited to present testimony on this very important subject. To my knowledge, this hearing is the first that the Congress of the United States has ever called specifically to address this issue.
#+END_QUOTE

Be as it may, the first time that the racial achievement gap has been discussed at national level, the international achievement gap had already entered the public consciousness with the Sputnik crisis (4 October 1957). In reality the problem was entirely manufactured. Indeed, the U.S.A. had a satellite ready for launch already in September of that year.  At any rate, on 17 March 1958, just a few months later, the U.S.A. placed the Vanguard TV-4 in orbit.  Unlike the Sputnik, this satellite is still in orbit today.  There was no technological superiority of the U.S.S.R. over the U.S.A..  There was however at that time a shortage of mathematicians.  Hence the National Defense Education Act (NDEA) was passed the next year on 2 September 1958.  Most of the funding provided by the law would be spent on higher education for mathematics and engineering students.  NDEA was successful and its objectives were attained.  Such can not be said about successive federal education legislation.

We may be able to make some interesting observations regarding the success of NDEA in relation to the AGs and governmentality.  One aspect is that the law acted on a population by appealing to the natural desires of its components and was interested in a general, statistical outcome and not an absolute one.  The target of the law were gifted students who had a desire to enter into what we call today STEM fields of study, but could otherwise not have done so for financial reasons.  NDEA specifically prohibited the federal government to interfere with state and local curricula and standards.

However, there was an 'adjustment' in the "complex of savoirs."  Up till now the federal government did not have to concern itself with the technical and academic skills of the population, it simple was not an issue.  Immigration would compensate for any deficiency in the school system or academia.  The arms race during WWII first and in the Cold War afterwards caused an unprecedented demand to mathematicians, engineers, and scientists.  Thus, the quantity and quality of the highly skill workforce entered the policy discourse.  It became part of the "complex of savoirs."

The following piece of federal legislation that I would like to examine with regard to the second dimension of governmentality is the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA).  ESEA is part of the "War on Poverty" by President Lyndon B. Johnson and has to be understood in the context of a period of profound social unrest.  During that time the danger that extreme poverty and discrimination could not be ignored or accepted anymore as a natural aspect of society because of its dangerous repercussions for the whole of U.S. society.  The only way to protect society was to intervene to reduce extreme poverty.  There was no other alternative because the option of not doing anything did not exist anymore.  As ESEA itself specifies in its declaration of policy "In recognition of the special educational needs of children of low-income families ...", the reduction of poverty as a federal duty became part of the "complex of savoirs."

Of course this is not the first time that the federal government had decided to intervene on behalf of the poor.  It did so during the "New Deal."  However, I think that here there is a difference.  The poverty that the New Deal intended to combat was caused by an imperfect application of the capitalistic system.  There was an unbalance, an unhealthy regulation of businesses, banking and investments.  In addition there was an agricultural system that was inappropriate for the climatic and pedological conditions of the Midwest.  Hence, these were structural problems that could be resolved within the framework capitalistic society.  Indeed productive, healthy, and skilled workers lost their jobs for no fault of their own.

On the contrary the target of the War on Poverty were people that had never been part of the active and productive labor force, but were people with no hope and prospects in even a well functioning U.S. economic system.  It is interesting to note that school reform was not part of the New Deal even though there were some job programs for unemployed teachers.  Obviously, it was recognized that the economic crisis was not caused by the school system.  As we see in this chapter, about seventy years later it becomes part of the "complex of savoirs" that schools, if not cause, certainly contribute to the economic malaise of the country.

What I find distinguishing about ESEA is that the funding does not go directly to its intended target.  It is not distributed to the "children of low-income families", a situation unlike NDEA where at least part of the funding went to the students themselves as tuition assistance.  The reason is that higher education operates in a 'market' while public education does not.  This situation creates according to the principles of governmentality an inefficient situation that requires more and more interventions that are based on a 'regime of discipline.'

# NCLB tries to "fix" ESEA by applying market-like tactics and calculations.

During the 1980s and 1990s several of the programs instituted by the "War of Poverty" were dismantled.  On 22 August 1996 President William Clinton signed into effect the "Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act" that as the president himself said "end[ed] welfare as we know it."  About three years later, on 21 May 1999, president sent to Congress his proposal for the re-authorization of ESEA titled "Educational Excellence for All Children Act of 1999."  It would not pass, but was very similar to the soon to come NCLB (See [[discussion-dim-1-population][Subsection 5.2.5]]).  A part of the following excerpt from the president's message to Congress reads

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Fourth, in response to clear evidence that standards-based reforms work best when States have strong accountability systems in place, my proposal would encourage each State to establish a single, rigorous accountability system for all schools. The bill also would require States to end social promotion and traditional retention practices; phase out the use of teachers with emergency certificates and the practice of assigning teachers ``out-of-field;'' and implement sound discipline policies in every school. Finally, the bill would give parents an important new accountability tool by requiring State, district, and school-level report cards that will help them evaluate the quality of the schools their children attend. (WCPD-1999-05-31-Pg964, Table \ref{tbl:docs-clinton})
#+END_QUOTE

The concept of *accountability* is mentioned twice in this quote.  How can we understand this concept, this /reflection and analysis/ that now enters the *complex of savoirs* of federal education policy?  On is accountable "for something to someone."  Usually in a contract something of value, usually money, is given for the delivery of a service or product.  The product or service has to correspond to certain characteristics as specified in the contract.  In addition it has to be delivered at a certain place and time.  Likewise payment has to be in the correct amount and delivered by the agreed on deadline.

However, teachers and staff are employees of a school district and operate according to an employment contract.  The above quote mentions states and parents, but the teachers and staff are under no contractual obligation with either of them.  Thus, they should be accountable to the school districts and no one else.  Are the school districts themselves accountable to the parents and or the states?  The answer is yes, to a certain degree.  Most school districts have elected boards and have some contractual or legal obligation towards the states.  With this in mind let us analyze the system of accountability requested in this act and implemented when NCLB was signed in January 2002 in light of governmentality and the achievement gaps.

I would like to make the following observations, (1) up to the passing of NCLB there was no legal requirement to close the AGs, (2) the NCLB accountability system tries to bring market forces into the school system, (3) due to the structure of the public school system the market forces can not properly operate in the public school system, (4) there is a cognitive dissonance between the intent of school reform, the /tactics/ of schools reform, and the structure and culture of the public school system.

Point (1) is quite straightforward and discussed repeatedly in this chapter.  Regarding points (2) and (3), the publication of school results (i.e. AYP), the information of the parents, and the collection, statistical analysis of the assessment data that is transmitted to the states and federal government creates a chain of accountability that is orthogonal to the structural of the schools system.  The people of the school district elect a board, this board hires a superintendent and the superintendent through the staff at the school district hires the teachers and principals.  As we can see, there is only one market force operating in this chain of responsibility, the package of salary, benefits, and working conditions offered by the school board to the superintendent, and by the school district to school faculty and staff.  This and only this determines the quality of teachers in a school district and their turnover.  Everything depends on the work conditions offered by the school districts.  All other state, federal or private interventions on teaching colleges, teacher appreciation and professional development are at best complementary and more realistically, and in the grand scheme of things, negligible.

Another /tactic/ by NCLB to bring market forces to bear in the public school system is school choice (figures \ref{fig:pres-docs-cid-22} and \ref{fig:congr-hearings-cid-22}).  However, the public school system operates in a system of monopoly or at best oligopoly.  There are school district boundary restrictions as well as availability of transportation and tolerable commuting time issues.

Thus summarizing intention by NCLB to introduce market forces are ineffective and resulted in the imposition of another set of bureaucratic burdens on the teachers and school and worse than that created a worsening of the work condition of the teachers and thus worked *against* the market forces that should bring into the schools the best available teachers.

Dr. Linda Darling-Hammond calls this phenomenon a "Dysfunctional consequence" of NCLB.  For instance she said during a House hearing on 2007-05-11 

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
As has occurred in many states with high stakes-testing programs, students who do poorly on the tests -- special needs students, new English language learners, those with poor attendance, health, or family problems -- are increasingly likely to be excluded by being counseled out, transferred, expelled, or by dropping out.
 
This kind of result is not limited to education. When one state decided to rank cardiac surgeons based on their mortality rates, a follow up investigation found that surgeons' ratings went up as they stopped taking on high-risk clients. These patients were referred out of state if they were wealthy, or were not served, if they were poor. (110hhrg34990, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-110hhrg34990})
#+END_QUOTE

Carrying the medical analogy a little further, would it be fair to judge a hospital and its staff according to whether or not *all* the patients got cured?  No physician would accept being held accountable to such a standard.  However, that is exactly what the states and the federal government are asking the teachers.  We can and should demand that a hospital follow sound medical procedures and be staffed by competent people.  However, it would be eminently unfair, and thus counter productive, to demand that all patients admitted to the hospital leave completely cured after a certain period.

Thus, we could ask ourselves why are schools asked to operate in such a dysfunctional situation?  According to the principles of governmentality of Foucault I understand this situation as the incomplete and inconsistent application of "government" in a system that still operates and is asked to operate in a /regime of discipline/ rather than as an /apparatus of security/.

#<<discussion-dim-3-into>>
The third dimension of Foucault's definition of /governmentality/ refers to the result of the process of transformation into administrative state (see [[lit-review-governmentality][Section 2.4]], point 3).  As we have seen in [[lit-review][Chapter 2]] many of the papers we have analyzed have described and often decried the increase in administrative complexity of the school system (e.g. \citeNP{Ellis:2008a}, yyy, zzz).

\citeA{Farkas:2000a} describe the evolution of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. The authors belong to the Brookings Institution (http://www.brookings.edu), ostensibly non-partisan, but in actuality quite conservative.  Farkas and Hall note that "schools are too little concerned with control and coordination" (p. 10). 

The authors showed how the rules for funding distribution and local allocation became more and more detailed with the ESEA amendments of 1969, 1974, 1978, 1981.  This increase in control and detail occurred as a response to what was called the "displacement of local funds."  Local authorities would use federal funds to sustain general expenses instead of devoting them exclusively to the targeted students.  This is an example of the complex interplay between local and federal education policy where the intent of the law collides with local policy and cultural realities.

In addition, the 1994 reauthorization increased the range of the target population from grades one through three to one through twelve.  The authors note the deleterious effect of fund dilution and thus ESEA's vanishing positive impact.  Why did the federal government thus do so?  It was based on two principles, 'inclusion of all students' and 'local flexibility'.  \citeA{Farkas:2000a} make the interesting (for me at least) proposal to have funds follow the students making Title I funding a 'portable entitlement'.  They note that with this type of reform "local Title I bureaucracies would be reduced in size, perhaps even eliminated." (page 93). The authors even go further and propose a parental controlled Title I expenditure account.  Such types of reforms do not have much traction.  Bureaucracies have a very strong 'survival instinct'.  

We can compare these proposal of the authors with the "Pell Grants for Kids" proposal by Senator Lamar Alexander in 2004 (see Senate hearing 108shrg94993 in Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-senate}, page \pageref{tbl:congr-hearings-senate} and Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-108shrg94993}, page \pageref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-108shrg94993}).  Senator John Francis Reed (Democrat, RI) and  Darlene Allen, president of the District of Columbia PTA, opposed the proposal giving as reason that it would subtract funds from public schools.  Senator Dodd (Democrat, Connecticut) likewise opposed the proposal by raising civil rights issues.  Also Robert Smith, superintendent for Arlington County Public Schools in Virginia, was against the proposal.  He raised issues of adequate accountability and diversion of funds from public schools.  Other opponents were the National Coalition for Public Education and a long list of organizations including religious and public school ones.  It is obvious why public school organization would oppose the proposal.  From the fact that the religious organization were politically liberal, I deduced that those signers were concerned about the fact that most private religious schools are conservative.  Thus, public money would indirectly support schools with a political outlook that conflicted with their own one.

#<<discussion-dim-3-federal-local>>

As we have seen, reauthorizations of ESEA are combined with increased federal control of public education.  However, the 2002 reauthorization was so complex and radical to merit its own name, the "No Child Left Behind Act of 2001" (NCLB, http://www2.ed.gov/policy/elsec/leg/esea02/index.html, the document has 670 pages). Apparently the act tries to balance federal control with state and local flexibility (figures \ref{fig:pres-docs-cid-1-2-3} and \ref{fig:congr-hearings-cid-1-2-3}).  It is important to notice that NCLB is a bi-partisan effort.  The Republican Party, unlike the Democratic Party, opposes, at least nominally, the /process/ leading to the /administrative state/.  In reality both parties are eager to use the /apparatuses of security/ as well as /regimes of discipline/ of the Federal or State governments to further their ideological interests.

It is interesting to notice how the expansion of the Federal control of K-12 public education is presented rhetorically.  It is a delicate act of balancing opposites and reduction of impacts.  An interesting set of statements in this regards was given by President George Bush in a communication with Congress in January 2001. He stated that "Change will not come by disdaining or dismantling the Federal role of education. I believe strongly in local control of schools." (WCPD-2001-01-29-Pg217, Table \ref{tbl:docs-bush}, page \pageref{tbl:docs-bush})  Note that NCLB was introduced in the House in March 2001.  Obviously, these are two opposite concepts, one right after the other. Another relevant statement in this communication was

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I oppose a national test, one designed here in Washington, DC, because I know it would undermine local control of schools and undermine State curricula. But States should test each student each year.
#+END_QUOTE

This discourse emphasizes state and local control, but implies federal control.  After all, the federal government imposes tests for "each student each year", which is hardly a trivial matter.  In this line later in this document we have

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We believe education is a national priority and a local responsibility, that Washington should be giving our schools help, not giving them orders.

#+END_QUOTE
The contrast between 'priority' and 'responsibility' in clear.  However, in actuality a 'national priority' is nothing less that an imposition from the central government to local governments. Also notice that the federal government 'gives help' to schools, no mention is made of all the rules and regulations that this help implies.  Again in "Local schools now have a mandate to reform, and we are giving them the freedom to reform." we have a 'mandate' balanced with 'freedom'.  This document concludes with several statements where the president underlines local control, such as "the agents of reform must be schools and school districts, not bureaucracies.", "Authority and accountability must be aligned at the local level", and "my passion for flexibility at the local level".  Of course the unstated is that the terms 'local control', 'agents of reform', 'authority' are operating in a legal and financial environment dictated by the federal government.

# WCPD-2002-01-14-Pg36

About a year after President Bush signed NCLB he gave some remarks on this law where he again uses the rhetorical device of the balance of opposites (WCPD-2002-01-14-Pg36, Table \ref{tbl:docs-bush}).  He stated that "We believe education is a national priority and a local responsibility, that Washington should be giving our schools help, not giving them orders." This in the face of hundred upon hundreds of pages of federal education legislation and regulations.  In "Local schools now have a mandate to reform, and we are giving them the freedom to reform." we see again a contrast between 'mandate' and 'freedom'.  An also in "unprecedented flexibility to decide ...  In return, we expect States to set standards of basic knowledge and to make steady progress toward meeting those standards." Similarly in the same the president stated "we will spend almost $400 million to help States design and administer tests. In return, we expect States ..." We have references here to an aspect of neo-liberal ideology, the importation into government practice of ideas from business management. Later we will discuss this aspect of education policy analysis.

A more blunt assertion of federal authority is also done in this document such as in "States must show us that overall student achievement is improving, and as importantly, they must show that the achievement gap between the disadvantaged students and other students is closing."  In that case the imposition is balanced by implied principles of the welfare of the children and civil rights.

A few months later, on 2002-05-23, a Senate hearing was held with the title "America's schools: providing equal opportunity or still separate and unequal?" (CHRG-107shrg79941, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-senate}, page \pageref{tbl:congr-hearings-senate}). During this event Judy Catchpole, Wyoming State Superintendent (Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-local}, page \pageref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-local}), gave a presentation.  While on the whole she showed a positive attitude towards NCLB, she remarked that

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Whether it is Title I, school nutrition or IDEA, your goal has always been to ``supplement and not supplant.'' This agreement between the Feds and the States has kept an important balance in the local traditions and the national importance of education.

I will share gently that you have also opened the doors on an incredible bureaucracy.
#+END_QUOTE

During this Senate hearing a very interesting statement was made by Hugh B. Price, president of the National Urban League (Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-orgs}, page \pageref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-orgs}, http://www.nul.org)

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Conventional wisdom holds that public education is a local responsibility. I don't buy that argument either. Chances are that children raised on farms in Idaho will manufacture Saturn automobiles in Tennessee. Youngsters reared in Chattanooga will become investment bankers on Wall Street.
 
Society has a compelling interest in the quality of America's high school graduates that justifies aggressive leadership by States and by the Federal Government.
#+END_QUOTE

The history of education is the U.S. has precedents where the federal government directly intervenes into local affairs for reasons of social justice.  For instance, the federal government had to intervene multiple times after Brown versus Board of Education verdict in 1951.  Hugh Price makes it clear in his statement that he does not trust the state governments to achieve educational equity and is asking the federal governments to intervene.  He certainly has history on his side on this argument.

A similar sentiment is expressed also during this hearing by Michael A. Rebell, executive director of the Campaign for Fiscal Equity (Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-orgs}).  He proposes that the federal government should force states to equalize funding for all schools in each state.  Although he does not use that kind of language and is more circumspect by employing the terms 'unnecessary and unacceptable anachronism', 'Federal encouragement', 'need not conflict with ... local control', and 'actually take control'.

# WCPD-2003-01-13-Pg39
#
The following year, in 2003, on occasion of the second anniversary of the signing of NCLB, the president gave another speech where the AGs were mentioned (WCPD-2003-01-13-Pg39, Table \ref{tbl:docs-bush}).  We can notice the balancing of opposites and the blunting of federal impositions. President Bush stated "Schools have a responsibility to improve, and they also have the freedom to improve in this law,".  Notice the use of 'responsibility' instead of 'obligation' and its connection to 'freedom'.  The statement continues with "I can assure you, I haven't changed my attitude about Federal control of schools. When I was the Governor of Texas, I didn't like the idea of Federal control of schools."  Ironically, this on the occasion of the passing of the largest federal education legislation.  

The following part of this statement has an interesting logical contrast, "Parents and educators ... are the agents of education reform."  The education reform is a imposition from the central government, but that is rhetorically overshadowed by naming the parents and educators as 'agents.'

Dr. Roderick R. Paige was U.S. Secretary of Education during the first presidential term of George Bush (2001-2005).  During a House hearing held on 2004-02-11 (CHRG-108hhrg91861, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-executive}, page \pageref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-executive}) he explained his understanding of the role of the federal government in education.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Because the Constitution was silent on the issue of public education, it is a responsibility of the States, including funding. However, we do have a national interest.  Although the Federal Government has been involved in education since the late 1800s, it only took a prominent role with the enactment of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. But the increased funds from this initiative proved to be an incomplete solution. In 1983, when the National Commission on Excellence in Education issued the groundbreaking report entitled, "A Nation at Risk," they chose their words purposefully. They did not issue a report entitled, "A Few States at Risk." Educational inequity does indeed place our nation at risk -- and it is for this reason that the No Child Left Behind Act is an important component of ensuring our nation's well-being.
#+END_QUOTE

We have previously seen how the increase of federal involvement has been justified by the failure of local policy to establish social justice.  In this case we have a different justification for federal action, a situation of /national interest/, nay /national risk/.  Michel Foucault devotes the final part of his 3rd lecture given on 24 January 1979 at the Collège de France to this problematic \cite[pp. 67-70]{Foucault:2010a}.  He said that

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The third consequence [of the liberal art of government], is the appearance in this new art of government [i.e. liberalism] of mechanisms with the function of producing, breathing life into, and increasing freedom, of introducing additional freedom through additional control and intervention.
#+END_QUOTE

He then gives examples of 'developing economic crisis' that will endanger the 'freedom to work, freedom of consumption, political freedom, and so on.' (p. 68).  Anyway, Secretary Paige continues his presentation in line with what the president has been saying and will continue to state, that 'Our role at the U.S. Department of Education is to supplement State and local efforts, not to supplant them.' and that 'A uniform set of ``federal standards'' does not exist.'  Those would be announced in June 2009 and would not be a federal initiative, but one by the National Governors Association (http://www.corestandards.org).  The /Common Core State Standards Initiative/ are discussed in the House Hearings 111hhrg53732 and 111hhrg55304 (Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-house}, page \pageref{tbl:congr-hearings-house}).  Ironically, the name of these standards include the term "State" even though for all intents and purposes it is a national standard.

# WCPD-2004-05-17-Pg856
#
On 2004-05-11 during a speech at a junior high school the president tried to explain the reason of this tension between local and federal control of public education (WCPD-2004-05-17-Pg856, Table \ref{tbl:docs-bush}).  He stated "the Federal Government is spending more money on education, but for the first time, we're asking for results."  Again, there is a statement that tries to express an opposing idea "Washington should not be primary funder of schools in America. That's up to the States and the local people."  Asking for results is /prima facie/ quite a reasonable argument, even common sense, and so it is presented.  In reality this demand requires the creation or at least large expansion of the /administrative state/ at all levels, federal, state and local.  Its implementation will raise questions, cause frictions and even resistance.  Thus more rules and regulations have to be created to cover all aspects, and prevent the use of 'loop holes', pushing the process of administrative expansion even further.  Consider the following statement in this document "You don't want Federal bureaucrats ... making the decision for the classrooms .... You need local control of schools ..." Local control, yes, but limited local control would be a more precise description.

Two months later Senator Lamar Alexander tried to roll back the /administrative state/ (2004-07-15, CHRG-108shrg94993, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-senate}, page \pageref{tbl:congr-hearings-senate}). As we have seen in [[discussion-dim-3-into][Subsection 5.4.1]] even though he received some support, his effort was a political dead end.

# WCPD-2004-08-16-Pg1561
#
The following month the president during an election speech made a statement (2004-08-11, WCPD-2004-08-16-Pg1561, Table \ref{tbl:docs-bush}) where a he sandwiched a statement supporting local control between two statement that advocated federal control, "We believe in accountability. We believe in local control of schools. We believe in challenging schools that refuse to change and refuse to teach."  The chain of terms is telling, 'accountability-control-challenge'.  The schools are accountable to the federal government and are challenged, that is regulated, by it.  However, control is local.  We have a 'strong' term between two 'soft' terms and the strong term is ideologically within the tradition of the Republican Party.

# WCPD-2004-08-23-Pg1587
#
The president would a few days later (2004-08-13) make similar statements (WCPD-2004-08-23-Pg1587), "We believe in local control of schools. When we find children in schools that won't change and won't teach, we demand something other than the status quo, and we're seeing great results. The achievement gap among students in America is beginning to close because we believe every child can learn."  Here we have 'local control' contrasted with 'demand'.  Both strong terms.  However, the federal government justifies its incise attitude by making appeal to the welfare of children and a civil rights principle.

# WCPD-2004-08-23-Pg1631
#
A few days later again (2004-08-17) president Bush stated in another election speech "We believe in accountability. We believe in local control of schools.  And when we find schools that will not teach and will not change, we're bold enough to challenge the status quo."  Again, we have the central-local-central triplet 'accountability-local-challenge'.  The handle is that it only applies to unreasonable schools that do not want to adapt to the new (economic) realities.

# WCPD-2004-08-23-Pg1644-2
# first mention NationInterComp
#
The following day (2004-08-18, WCPD-2004-08-23-Pg1644-2) during another electoral speech the president gave he stated "And so the No Child Left Behind Act sets high expectations and high standards. It believes in local control of schools. It believes in empowering parents. But it also says, Let's measure to determine whether curriculum works, to determine whether or not our children are learning to read."  We have thus a variant of this triple, 'expectations/standards - local/empowering - measure/determine', where each term is undergoes mitosis.

# WCPD-2004-09-06-Pg1720
#
During another electoral speech (WCPD-2004-09-06-Pg1720) the president stated "We increased Federal funding, but we increased local control of schools and accountability across America so not one child is left behind in this country."  We have again a 'central-local-central' triplet followed by a motivation.

# WCPD-2004-09-06-Pg1727

Without giving the details we see that this also happened in another later election speech, WCPD-2004-09-06-Pg1727.  A telling remark is the following in WCPD-2004-09-06-Pg1727, where he addressed a school superintendent, "I believe in local control of schools, and I wanted somebody in Washington who understood all wisdom about education is not in the bureaucracies of Washington;"  We have 'local-Washington/positive-Washinton/negative triplet.  We have a secretary in the federal capital as head of the federal Department of Education, but he is actually not part of 'Washington'.  Later in the same speech we have mention of results for money, and measurement for the benefits of the children, by now a familiar rhetorical scheme.

# WCPD-2005-01-17-Pg45
#
In a speech at a high school given in January 2005 (WCPD-2005-01-17-Pg45, Table \ref{tbl:docs-bush}) the president used said that "The role of the Federal Government is to serve as a funding source for specific projects and an instigator for accountability systems."  Note the terms 'specific' and 'instigator.'  Rhetorically they have the function to lighten the perception of the weight of federal control on education.  Indeed, Mr. Bush continues with "The accountability system is, of course, devised by local people." and "I believe Federal control of the public school systems leads to failure."  Similar conciliatory language were later expressed, such as "Federal Government to work with the State government .... to provide incentives" , and "the Federal Government will take your side and help you." (WCPD-2005-07-18-Pg1158), "I don't think you want the Federal Government funding all public schools." (WCPD-2006-01-16-Pg26-2), "the Federal Government needs to play a vital role. One, a vital role is to set the goals and strategies," (WCPD-2006-04-24-Pg734), "there needs to be a collaborative effort between the Federal Government and the State government" (WCPD-2006-05-01-Pg751), 

Many examples could be presented about the complex give-and-take between the federal and local education policies.  One aspect that was the topic of a House hearing (CHRG-109hhrg28431, 2006-06-13) was how to disaggregate the data between ethnic/racial/income groups.  Actually, the issue was even finer than that, it was about the N-size, that is the minimum number that a certain group of students (in NCLB language 'subgroup') should be included in the AYP calculations.  Those who were more concerned with decentralization would support a higher number than those who would be more concerned about civil rights and the achievement gap.  For instance, John C. Brittain, Chief Counsel and Senior Deputy Director, Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law stated during this hearing

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Congress did not prescribe a minimum ``N'' size in the law, or even an acceptable range. Rather, the law leaves it up to the states to set their ``N'' size (as well as other accountability requirements) and to submit their accountability plans to the Secretary of Education for approval. 

...

But, it raises reasonable suspicion that some states are trying to permit schools and districts to evade their responsibilities

...

I recommend that NCLB maintain the full provisions for disaggregation of data. In addition, to fix the ``N'' size loophole problem, the Committee should consider proposing legislation that continues to provide states with discretion, but sets a maximum limit on the number of excluded students. In addition, if the state excludes a minimum number of students from testing, it should review the data on the excluded students to determine their level of proficiency.
#+END_QUOTE

In other words, he promotes that the federal government regulate the states education policy because of a 'loophole'.  This is one aspect of the 'metastatic' government.  When a rule is established then opposing forces arise in the periphery which force the center to be more and more specific and capillary in its regulations and rules.  The natural result is a complex and pervasive system that requires a vast amount of bureaucracy and legal counsels.

Indeed, two months later another House hearing was held to examine another issue with the implementation of NLCB (2006-08-28, CHRG-109hhrg29626), the provision that in each classroom there should be a "highly qualified teacher".  NCLB specifies what that means and it is the first time that the qualification of teachers was specified at a federal level.  As with any new federal regulation there was a degree of opposition from the states.  However, usually it was not a strident or vociferous opposition, but a silent one.  Basically, the states would ignore this provision or try to water it down to a point where the requirements would be already met by existing situations in the state.  As we have seen many organizations and activists who were concerned with educational equity would ask the federal government to intervene and force the states to comply with this provision.  An example of this action is the statement by Phyllis McClure, Dianne Piche and William L. Taylor of the Citizens' Commission on Civil Rights (http://www.cccr.org, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-orgs} and Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-109hhrg29626}).  Their statement contains the following language about federal vis-à-vis state and local education policy

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In the weeks and months following the states' submissions of their July 7th plans, there are several key issues that Congress, advocates, educators, and the press should be sure to track, including: (a) exactly how states say they will address the teacher quality provisions of the law during the upcoming year, (b) how carefully the Department of Education evaluates and enforces the revised state plans during 2006-2007, and (c) whether states take meaningful action to address the law's requirements or continue their patterns of resistance, delay, and misreporting.
 
Increased scrutiny during 2006-2007 is necessary because states, districts, and the U.S. Department of Education have over the past four years demonstrated high levels of inattention and, in some instances, deep-seated resistance to the law's teacher quality provisions.  (Already, some states, like Utah, have indicated in the press that they plan to ignore the July 7th date and submit their revised plans in the fall.)
 
Providing qualified teachers for low-income children is one of the most important and challenging elements of the law. The likely consequence of a continued lack of state and federal enforcement is clear. The most significant national effort to date to reform and improve public schools will be deemed a failure, not because it had been tried and found wanting, but because it had really not been tried at all. And the losers will be children.
#+END_QUOTE

The following year the Senate held a hearing on the same subject (2007-03-06, CHRG-110shrg34052, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-senate}).  Amy Wilkins, Vice President for Government Affairs and Communications, The Education Trust (http://www.edtrust.org/) made a very similar statement to the previous one given at the House hearing.

# WCPD-2007-03-05-Pg238
#
Even in the following years the discourse about federal control is similar.  It is minimized, hedged, almost hidden.  On 2007-01-02 the president gave a speech at an elementary school and started it with "I want to talk about schools and the Federal role in schools relative to local governments" (WCPD-2007-03-05-Pg238). Then later he said

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I fully understand some are nervous when they hear a President talking about Federal education. You start thinking to yourself, the Government is going to tell you what to do here at the local level. Quite the contrary, in this piece of legislation. I strongly believe in local control of schools. I believe it's essential to align authority and responsibility. And by insisting upon local control of schools, you put the power where it should be -- closest to the people.
#+END_QUOTE

As we know, in reality the opposite happened with NCLB.  This is implicitly acknowledged by later stating that "if you spend money, you should insist upon results."  In other words, the federal government has power and it will exercise it.

# CHRG-110hhrg35664
#
It should be clear by now that in this local versus federal policy controversy does not follow political party fault lines. There was a convergence of interest for both parties when NCLB was passed and there is a convergence of interests also for those who oppose it. With this in mind it is interesting to examine a statement given on 2007-06-07 by Chester E. Finn, Jr., President of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute and Chairman of the Koret Task Force on K-12 Education at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
In Washington, these debates about prescription versus flexibility and the proper federal role quickly become ideological. Conservatives tend to argue that states have constitutional authority for schooling and the federal government should simply leave them alone. (Never mind that plenty of states have an abysmal record of providing a decent education, especially for poor and minority kids.) Liberals are apt to insist that states can't be trusted and that only strong federal enforcement of specific measures will lead to a narrowing of the achievement gap. (Never mind that plenty of states were making decent strides in raising achievement and narrowing gaps sans federal prodding.)

Neither view is right. Each leads to a bad outcome: Either "put the money on the stump," let states and schools do whatever they want, and hope for the best; or micromanage fifty states, 15,000 districts and tens of thousands of schools through miles of red tape. Neither approach works, not, at least, if stronger student achievement is the metric by which success is judged.
#+END_QUOTE

The above statement is very interesting and should be read in its entirety (CHRG-110hhrg35664, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-orgs} and Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-110hhrg35664}) because it analyzes the federal versus state and local education policies.

The succeeding president altered the discourse slightly and advanced the grow of the /administrative state/ by complementing NCLB with RTTT.  President Obama in 2009-07-24 made a speech at the U.S. Department of Education where he stressed, among other issues the collaboration between all parties interested in public education, from the parents all the way up to Washington (DCPD-200900595).

The following year, on 2010-02-26, in presence of African American leaders he mentioned the collaboration between the federal and the state governments in the resolution of the achievement gaps (DCPD-201000130).

# coding descriptive statistics
#
The descriptive statistics of the codings confirm the rhetorical analysis of the presidential documents by President George Bush.  The code for local control ranks number 15, for state control 22 and federal control only 33 by frequency (Table \ref{tbl:pres-docs-number-codings}).  The ranking by number of speeches follows the same trend (Table \ref{tbl:pres-docs-files-code}).  The frequency rankings are the opposite in the Congressional hearings (Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-number-codings} and Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-files-code}) most likely a sign of the concerns raised about federal control of education.

The cross-codes table of the Congressional hearings shows the highest overlap of federal control of education with educational equity (Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-cross-code}).  The same table for the Presidential documents presents another interesting feature.  The highest overlap of local control of education is with school reform (Table \ref{tbl:pres-docs-cross-code}).  However, in the other collection is federal control that is most correlated.  Again a sign of contrasting discourse between the local concerns and the statements of the administration.

# text mining
#
The analysis of the content-rich words (text mining) confirms the above observations.  Among the top 50 most frequent terms in the Presidential documents the term 'local' appears, but not the terms 'state' and 'federal' (rank 35, unstemmed, Table \ref{tbl:pres-docs-freq-terms}).  As noted previously, in the Congressional hearings the situation is the opposite, the term 'federal' ranks number 17 and the terms 'local' and 'state' are not among the 50 most frequent terms (Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-freq-terms}).

The cluster dendrogram of the most frequent terms of the Presidential documents show a closeness of the terms 'feder', 'govern' and 'local' (Figure \ref{fig:pres-docs-freq}).

On 2007-03-15, during a speech given at a dinner of the National Republican Congressional Committee, the President introduced a new component in this rhetorical structure, the international standing of the US economy (WCPD-2007-03-19-Pg338-2, Table \ref{tbl:docs-bush}).  This speech was given on the heels of the 'Chinese correction', when the Dow-Jones Industrial Average experienced the biggest one-day drop since the September 11 attacks.  The great recession had not yet started.  It seems that the first public sign of it was the action on 7 August 2007 of BNP Paribas blocking the withdrawal from three hedge funds.[fn:119]  However, the housing bubble had already started to burst.[fn:120]  Indeed in this speech the president stated "We've got work to do to make sure this economy continues to stay strong." and then

We believe strongly that this country needs to remain competitive so that we can remain the economic leader in the world. And one of the best ways to remain competitive is to make sure our youngsters get a good, sound education. I believe strongly in local control of schools, but I also believe in raising standards and holding schools accountable for achieving results.
#+END_QUOTE

Here we have again the triplet 'make sure' - 'local control' - 'standards/accountability'.  But this time instead of making appeal to business or common sense or civil rights, the president makes appeal to the competitiveness of the US economy (figures \ref{fig:pres-docs-cid-13-15-17} and \ref{fig:congr-hearings-cid-13-15-17}).  A very good indicator of the position on the US economy in the world is the trade balance.  However, since 1975 the balance has been negative.  However, from 1998 to 2006 this deficit has steadily worsened, increasing by more than 600 billion dollars (see Figure \ref{fig:trade-balance}).

This is not the first time that the president mentioned international economic competition in a speech on education and local or federal control of education (WCPD-2004-08-23-Pg1644-2 on 2004-08-18, see Table \ref{tbl:pres-docs-control-econ}). However, this was the first time that he connected it so closely to the governmental control of education.  The prime indicator of international competition, the trade balance had worsened significantly starting in 1998 (see Figure \ref{fig:CBO}).[fn:121]

Just two days previously on 2007-03-13 during a joint Senate-House hearing on the re-authorization of ESEA (110jhrg33757, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-110jhrg33757} and Table {tbl:congr-hearings-authors-orgs}) Reg Weaver, President of the National Education Association (http://www.nea.org), made several statements where he asked for increased governmental involvement at all levels.  He used international competitiveness several times as one of the motivations for these interventions.  Reg Weaver asked congress to force states to raise the compulsory school attendance age to "to ensure future competitiveness,".  He also proposed that states increase funding for education by changing their fiscal policies "to maintain America's competitive edge in this global, knowledge-based economy".

The following month a Senate hearing on the NCLB re-authorization was held (2007-04-24, 110shrg35072, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-110shrg35072} and Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-senate}).  Among the presenters was Dr. Robert Balfanz, researcher at the Center for Social Organization of Schools at the John Hopkins University (Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-110shrg35072} and Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-univ}).  He encouraged "well-conceived action by the Federal government" to "play a catalytic role in ending the Nation's dropout crisis and in so doing change the Nation fundamentally for the better." Notice the terms 'action' and 'catalytic role'.  Later in this statement Dr. Balfanz has 'Federal-State-local partnership'.  The increasing role of the federal government in education is again expressed in /mild/ terms.

It should be noted that Margaret Spellings, the U.S. Secretary of Education, had previously made a reference to international competition and state policy control at her Senate confirmation hearing (2005-01-06, CHRG-109shrg97751, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-109shrg97751} and Table  \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-executive})

Even though the federal education budget was negligible in the context of total of the national budget, it is frequently mentioned.  For example in speech given on 2007-06-25 to the Presidential Scholars mentions both (WCPD-2007-07-02-Pg858)

The philosophy behind the law is straightforward. It says the Federal Government should expect results in return for the money it spends.  That's not too much to ask, I don't think.

....

Our ability to compete in the 21st century depends upon educating children just like the ones standing behind me. Whether we like it or not, we're in a global world. And if the world needs engineers or scientists, and those scientists are being educated in China and India and not being educated in the United States, the jobs of the 21st century are likely to go there. And so we better make sure that we have a strategy aimed at making sure that we have high expectations and good results for every child in the United States, if we expect to remain competitive.

....

The Federal Government has said, ``We believe in local control of schools; you reform them; you fix them.'' We're just going to insist that you measure, in return for the billions we spend on your behalf.

Note in the last statement the triplet 'you fix/you reform' - 'we insist' - 'your behalf'.  The strong term is sandwiched between to soft ones. The first term is a statement of local agency, then a non legal term, and then a statement of local benefit, a large amount of funding. President Bush has often connected local control with funding.

*** STRT Control and Funding					     :subsec:
#<<discussion-dim-3-control-funding>>
There are three basic themes in the speeches of President Bush concerning governmental control of education and funding

(1) The federal government has the right to demand results for the money it disburses, e.g. "in return for extra Federal money, you measure." (WCPD-2004-09-06-Pg1727) "we believe in return for Federal money, people must show us whether or not the children can read and write and add and subtract" (WCPD-2004-09-06-Pg1790), "We're spending a lot of Federal money, particularly on Title I students; show us whether or not the money is being well spent." (WCPD-2006-03-13-Pg434), "The Federal Government is asking for demonstrated results in exchange for the money we send from Washington." (WCPD-2006-10-16-Pg1765) and "In exchange for Federal dollars, however, we expect results." (WCPD-2009-01-12-Pg22-3)

(2) Federal funding of education is, and should remain, only a small fraction of the total education budget, e.g. "It's the primary responsibility of the State and local governments to fund schools, not the Federal Government." (WCPD-2004-05-17-Pg856), "The role of the Federal Government is to serve as a funding source for specific projects and an instigator for accountability systems." (WCPD-2005-01-17-Pg45), "We're not going to fund it all, but we're going to make targeted funding. And it's a good use of money," (WCPD-2006-01-16-Pg26-2), and "the Federal Government only spends about 7 percent of the total education budgets around the country, and frankly, that's the way I think it should be." (WCPD-2007-03-05-Pg238)

(3) The federal government has increased federal funding of education, but only because it is necessary to implement /accountability/, a term connected to return of investment and business efficiency. The federal government can not renege on Title I.  As we have commented, almost never does the government shrink, the innate tendency is to grow, and pervade society more and more. In this case /accountability/ (a business principle) and the /closing of the AGs/ (a social justice principle) are given as a reason for the increase in governmental control.  See for instance, "We are increasing support and funding for research into teaching methods that work." (WCPD-2002-01-14-Pg36, note the business efficiency reason), "It said the Federal Government is spending more money on education, but for the first time, we're asking for results." (WCPD-2004-05-17-Pg856), "We increased Federal funding, but we've also started to ask important questions: Can our children read and write and add and subtract?" (WCPD-2004-08-23-Pg1631), "We increased Federal funding, but we increased local control of schools and accountability across America so not one child is left behind in this country." (WCPD-2004-09-06-Pg1720, note the juxtaposition of business efficiency and social justice), "in return for extra Federal money, you measure." (WCPD-2004-09-06-Pg1727), "in return for increasing Federal spending, ... strong accountability measures ... correct a child's learning problems early" (WCPD-2004-09-27-Pg2085), "in return for extra spending, we now want people to measure" (WCPD-2004-10-18-Pg236), "Title I program spending has increased 45 percent since 2001." (WCPD-2006-01-16-Pg26-2), "in return for Federal money -- in increasing amounts ... We expect you to measure." (WCPD-2006-05-01-Pg769-2), and "extra funding for under-performing schools. ... if you measure," (WCPD-2007-07-02-Pg858).

Soon after the signing of NCLB education secretary Roderick Paige spoke about funding saying that "these new dollars are focused on changing the culture of our education system and closing the achievement gap." (107shrg70756 on 2001-03-06, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-107shrg70756} and Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-executive}), which recalled point (3) of president Bush.  He also tried to blunt the impact of this new law by adding "educed bureaucracy and greater flexibility for States, school districts, and schools;"   His deputy, Eugene Hickok basically repeated the same type of language the following year (2002-04-23, 107shrg79324, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-107shrg79324} and Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-executive}) with "flexibility of States, local educational agencies, and schools to use Federal funds in a manner that best reflects State and local needs and priorities.  ... in exchange for committing themselves to improving student achievement and narrowing achievement gaps."

The following month, on 2002-05-23, a Senate hearing was held on the topic of school equity, a concept that is closely related to the AGs (107shrg79941, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-senate}).  Senator Micheal Enzi, a Republican member of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, made a statement (Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-senator} and Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-107shrg79941}) where he said

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
I am pleased that we will have an opportunity to examine the implications of extending unprecedented Federal control into our Nation's schools. At the end of the day I hope we can agree that the Federal Government must continue to target our resources to the students who are the most in need, while resisting the urge to interfere with ongoing school finance litigation based on individual State constitutions.
#+END_QUOTE 

This is an obvious reference to NCLB and all its impositions on state and local education policy and another problematic, school funding inequality, a consequence of the local funding of schools in the U.S.A..  Thus, this statement is a grudging acceptance of the expansion of the /administrative state/ for certain aspects and its rejection in another sector of education policy.  Local funding of schools seems to be the last holdout of local control since today we basically have a pervasive federal education policy and a national curriculum and there is talk about aligning state tests with the National Education Assessment Program test.  What is still left as a local matter is school funding.  Why is this still the case in face of just about everything else being unified on a national level?  I suppose the reason is that we do not have a 'convergence of interest'.  The only sector of society that would benefit are the poor and thus those with little political influence.  Those that would loose the most are the wealthy, those that not only vote, but give the bulk of political contributions.

Anyway, NCLB has the goal of eliminating the AGs, but does not address funding inequality.  That problematic is often the purview of another branch of the government, the judiciary.  Many legal actions have been taken by civil rights organizations in this regard.  As we have seen reference to this situation was made in this Senate hearing.  A different side was presented in this setting by Hugh B. Price, president of the National Urban League (http://www.nul.org, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-orgs} and Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-107shrg79941}).  He said in this committee hearing that

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The National Urban League is pleased that the President and Congress have made education a priority. We are concerned however, that education funding continues to be unequal between poor and wealthy school districts.

...

In exchange for meeting the new demands, poorer school districts will receive additional Federal funding, and all States and school districts will have greater flexibility in how they use Federal funds.

...

No longer should poor and minority children be held hostage to communities with low tax bases, with weak commitments from States to provide quality education, and skinflint taxpayers who oppose providing equal and adequate support for all schools in their State.

...

Having imposed high standards on all children, the Government now has the moral, financial and legal obligation to guarantee high quality education for every child.
#+END_QUOTE

In other words NCLB is incomplete, it does not address (adequately) the financial situation of public education and can thus not fully resolve the barriers to the elimination of the AGs.  Thus, the /administrative state/ should expand.  Again, appeal is made to the federal government to perceived negligence of the states.  As we have seen there is a history in the US where state government hinder, ignore, or sabotage federal civil rights legislation.

At this point I would like to go forward in time several years to examine a Senate hearing that was held to discuss the re-authorization of ESEA, i.e. NCLB (2010-03-09, 111shrg55474, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-senate}).  It should be noted that we are at the beginning of the presidential term of Barack Obama, that NCLB has been in effect for about nine years and that the war on poverty was started 45 years previously.  Among the experts that participated in this hearing was Dennis van Roekel, president of the National Education Association (NEA, successor of the previously mentioned Reg Weaver).  The president of NEA said the following about the control of education and school funding

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The Federal Government plays a critical role in ensuring that all children -- especially the most disadvantaged -- have access to an education that will prepare them to succeed in the 21st century. The Federal Government should focus on high-quality early childhood education, parental/family involvement and mentoring programs, as well as quality healthcare for children to help overcome issues of poverty that may impede student progress. It should support community school initiatives in an effort to address these issues comprehensively; must invest in proven programs such as knowledge-rich curricula and intensive interventions; and must provide resources to improve teaching and learning conditions through smaller classes and school repair and modernization.

...

Finally, it [i.e. the federal government] can develop policies that encourage States to play a more active role in monitoring and addressing (through "Adequacy and Equity Plans") specific success factors and disparities in schools that are persistently low-achieving or that have significant educational opportunity gaps. By requiring States to detail plans for helping close these fiscal and resource gaps in their Adequacy and Equity Plans, the U.S. Department of Education and the public can begin to provide critical support for State and local efforts to provide adequate and equitable funding for all schools.
#+END_QUOTE

Thus, the NEA is calling for an increase in federal control over the states by giving directives beyond what NCLB required (Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-orgs} and Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-111shrg55474}).

In the following year a House hearing took place on the role of the federal government in education (2011-03-01, 112hhrg64657, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-house}).  By now the calls for reforming NCLB can not be ignored anymore and the political discourse has shifted from the mere 'flexibility' to actual reform of NLCB.  Among the participants was Kati Haycock, the president of The Education Trust (Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-orgs} and Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-112hhrg64657}).  Kati Haycock made the following statements during her presentation about the 'burdens' of NCLB on local and state education activities

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
These are the burdens -- often horrendous ones, I might add -- to which Congress should turn its attentions during reauthorization, sheering off unnecessary regulatory burden and producing a ``thin'' law with a clear focus on improved results.

....

The school improvement provisions of the law, for example, require the development of a plan that, by some counts, contains no fewer than 17 elements, most of which are simply pulled from a grab bag of activities important to various interest groups. I saw the effect of this in a recent visit to a small school district in the Midwest.  Here's what happens: The federal government demands a plan with 17 elements, and sends that requirement to the state. The State Department of Education, in its infinite wisdom, turns that 17 into 55, formats them within a 100-page plan, and demands the plan BEFORE school starts.  For the principals of these schools, the burden looks like this: six 12-hour days to produce a plan, which -- to be a real plan -- has to be redone two weeks later once their teachers return and can provide input.

....

Requirements like these are one of the reasons why the current law is more than 1,000 pages long, and why the regulations issued under it add another approximately 300 pages.
#+END_QUOTE

The president of the Education Trust has provided an interesting panorama on the advancement of the /administrative state/.

The descriptive statistics of the QDA codings show that the code for school funding (/EducFunding/) in the Congressional hearings shares the largest number of paragraphs with the code for school reform (413, /SchoolReform/, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-cross-code}) and that a close second is the code for the poverty of the students and their families (406).  The analysis of the codings of the Presidential documents agrees with the discourse analysis in this section that the focus of federal funding has shifted from simply addressing poverty (original intent of ESEA) to a return-on-investment policy (NCLB and RTTT).  The code for funding is correlated the highest with school reform (127, Table \ref{tbl:pres-docs-cross-code}), then with student assessment (108, /StudentAssess/), followed by school accountability (67, /SchoolAccount/) and only then student poverty (61).

*** STRT Control and Testing					     :subsec:
#<<discussion-dim-3-control-testing>>
Another arena where we see conflict between the center and periphery of education policy is the imposition of the testing of students first and teachers later from the federal government.  The process is amply reflected in the political discourse that I have examined as well as in the academic literature (refs).

The rhetorical stance of President Bush has been, as we have seen previously, to minimize the federal control. Many times he stated that he opposed a national test.  In addition he preferred to use oblique terms to indicate that NCLB imposes mandatory testing for all students such as 'you measure' or 'we must measure', 'you show', 'states should test', 'people must show us', 'diagnose the problem', 'your (own) test', 'demonstrated results', and 'you need to measure'.

A few days after he signed NCLB he stated "I oppose a national test, ... it would undermine local control of schools and undermine State curricula. But States should test each student each year. Without yearly testing, we don't know who is falling behind and who needs help." (2001-01-23, WCPD-2001-01-29-Pg217, Table \ref{tbl:docs-bush}). We have the by now common structure of 'local-central-reason'.

The following year, on 2002-04-23, the Democratic Senate co-author of NCLB, Senator Edward Kennedy, gave a statement during a hearing titled 'Implementation of the No Child Left Behind Act' (107shrg79324, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-senate} and Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-107shrg79324}).

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
First, we must ensure that the law is applied fairly, allowing room for State and local initiatives permitted under the new law. In passing the new law, Congress was clear about its expectations. We demanded tough accountability for results.  We want to know whether schools are improving and helping our children do better. We required annual tests of the highest quality that provide the disaggregated data that schools need to know in order to determine what additional help is required for each and every child to succeed.
#+END_QUOTE

We notice that the annual test is qualified by the expression 'highest quality', a designation that can be interpreted and applied in many different and conflicting ways.  NCLB is a splendid example of 'convergence of interests' that has shaped civil rights reforms in the US (refs).  Its wide acceptance created boundaries of the educational reform discourse for many years.  As we have seen, only in 2009-2010 with a new president the discourse progressed beyond mere calls for 'improvements' and 'increased flexibility', and reform of NCLB became part of the federal education policy discourse.  This is part of the tendency of the /administrative state/, it rarely is reduced.  A law, especially a complex and pervasive one becomes a permanent fixture of policy.  At best it can or must be 'reformed', never abolished because of the multiplicity of vested interests that such a law has created on society.

Thus, the discourse of Senator Kennedy is within the boundaries of the NCLB policy framework.  He is requesting a "high quality" test, all those engaged in public education need to be "full partners in the reform," and "we must take local concerns seriously", and above all, "we must provide significant increases in the funding".

In subsequent speeches to WCPD-2001-01-29-Pg217 the president gave several variations on this theme. For instance during an electoral speech he said "we've raised the standards. That's why we believe in local control of schools. And that's why we measure, so we can solve problems early, before it is too late." (WCPD-2004-10-18-Pg2330) In the preceding statement we see 'central-local-central-reason' structure, which is somewhat unusual.  Maybe this is due to the fact that the speech was given in front of a mixed audience in an economically depressed area of the country (Hobbs, NM) that would not consider education or local control of it a primary concern.  In WCPD-2005-07-18-Pg1158 we can read "We raised the standards, and we said to local school districts, Show us. That's all we want to know. We want to know whether or not a child can read."  We have a federal imposition that is blunted by the remark "that is all we want to know" and the benefit of children who can read.  The "all we want to know" corresponded to a vast increase in testing with its associated costs and expansion of the educational administrative structure.  We will we in the analysis of the Congressional hearings how this "all we want to know" impacted teachers and school administrators.

Two years later the president stated at an elementary school that "We did not design a Federal test. .... States ... accountability systems, and ... local accountability systems." (WCPD-2006-01-16-Pg26-2) and "for those of you who think, well, the Federal Government has reached too far into the governance issue, it's just not true. It's not the case. As a matter of fact, quite the contrary; it makes sure that there was local control of schools."  It is understandable that to this type of audience the president would stress local control.  A few days later, 2006-01-19, the president made an almost identical statement, "We didn't design a Federal test; we just said, You design an accountability system." (WCPD-2006-01-23-Pg80-2) He also stated "We expect you to measure. You notice I didn't say, we expect you to administer the test we designed." (WCPD-2006-05-01-Pg769-2), and "I believe in local control of schools, but I do believe in accountability." (WCPD-2006-05-08-Pg838), and "I believe a Federal test undermines local control of schools." (WCPD-2007-03-05-Pg238)

During this same period the U.S. Secretary of Education under President Bush, Margaret Spellings, made very similar conciliatory statements.  For instance on 2006-04-06 during a House hearing titled "Building America's competitiveness" (109hhrg27978, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-house} and Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-109hhrg27978})

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The standards and assessment requirements of No Child Left Behind are, in fact, designed and intended to encourage mastery of challenging material and higher-order thinking skills. For example, the Department's regulations governing the State assessments required by NCLB specifically state that these assessments must include ``measures that assess higher-order thinking skills and understanding of challenging content.'' However, decisions about how to structure the school day or year. as well as about the precise kind of teaching and learning required to meet challenging State standards, fall squarely within the realm of State and local control over education. We do give States, school districts, and schools considerable flexibility in the use of Federal formula grant funds to support the kinds of adaptations you describe, but we leave it up to State and local authorities to decide what adaptations are appropriate for their unique circumstances.
#+END_QUOTE

At the beginning regulations and obligations are general and designed to be widely accepted.  Then the implementation takes place and the give-and-take of all local administrative structures as well as national and local pressure groups will slowly but steadily over time add more and more detail and bureaucratic overhead.  Examples of this phenomenon are the troubles with N-size (as we have seen in  [[discussion-dim-3-federal-local][Subsection 5.4.2]], teacher qualifications, and the distribution of funds. Consider for instance that the State of Connecticut sued the US Department of Education because it wanted to test its children every other year instead of each year as NCLB requires (see the statement of John C. Brittain, Chief Counsel and Senior Deputy Director, Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, 109hhrg28431, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-authors-orgs} and Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-109hhrg28431}).

As an indication of the snowball effect of legal requirements of NCLB are the calculations of the Adequate Yearly Progress of each school.  A few years after the implementation of the law new ways for the AYP computations are proposed that would be more 'fair' and would be in line with 'local flexibility', such as 'growth models' where the increase in test scores instead of simple score 'snapshots' would be used.  However, growth models are more mathematically complicated and require more data.  New computer systems would have to be purchased and maintained and additional data analysts would have to be added to school administration.  Such problems were discussed on 2006-07-27 during a House hearing titled "No Child Left Behind: Can Growth Models ensure improved education for all students?" (109hhrg28839, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-house} and \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-109hhrg28839}).

President Bush did not make any pronouncements regarding the assessments of teachers. The reason is that NCLB did not require it.  It required that all teachers be "highly qualified" their subject of teaching.  However, a later stage of federal education legislation, passed in July 2009 and called /Race to the Top/ does require a form of teacher evaluation tied to the performance of the students. I would like to offer two comments. First, RTTT follows the clear trend of federal control of education by imposing even more requirements than NCLB does. Second, the educational policy in the U.S.A. is peculiar in that it is not overtly a piece of education legislation, but is always tied to something else.  NCLB is a part of ESEA which is part of Lyndon B. Johnson's "War on Poverty".  RTTT is part of the "American Recovery and Reinvestment Act".  Why, probably because of the residual effect of the fact that the constitution of the U.S.A. does not have any provision regarding education.  Thus, the federal government has to provide at least lip service to this situation and place education legislation as part of something else.

President Barack Obama introduced RTTT to Congress and the federal Department of Education on 24 July 2009 (DCPD-200900595).  There is a remark in this speech on the control of education and teacher assessments, "If you set and enforce rigorous and challenging standards and assessments, if you put outstanding teachers ..."  There is also language by President Obama where the federal government explicitly demands that state education policy be changed.  In a speech at a middle school he said "Any State that has a so-called firewall law will have to remove them." (DCPD-200900884, 2009-11-04)  The firewall law would a state law that prevents the use of student test scores in teacher assessments. However, the administrative state based on neo-liberal principles requires it.  All decisions have to be sound business decisions and sound business decisions can only be based on 'real' data, that is numerical data.  In line with giving the appearance of local control of education no federal legislation could outright demand a state to modify its own education legislation.  However, it could 'entice' it to do so.  The true and tested method of the federal government to do so is to use money, funding.  State governments are almost always in need of more money.  State governments are usually not allowed to run a gigantic budget deficit as the federal government may, it also is prohibited from printing money.  This makes it practically impossible for state governments to ignore federal funding.

The US Senate held a hearing on 2010-03-09 to discuss the ESEA re-authorization (111shrg55474, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-senate} and Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-111shrg55474}).  One of the presenters was a non American expert, Andreas Schleicher, Division Head and coordinator of the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and the OECD Indicators of Education Systems programme.  In his contribution he made interesting observations on how the US education policy system compares with other ones when he spoke about the International Achievement Gap

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Education systems in the industrialized world have improved more rapidly than the United States. Over the last decade, the United States has fallen from second place to 14th in terms of its college graduation rate. While primary-grade school children tend to do well by international standards, the latest PISA assessments show U.S. students performing below the OECD average. The United States also has a comparatively large achievement gap, which signals serious risks for students in their initial transition from education to work and of failing to benefit from further education and learning opportunities in their later life.

...

National educational standards have helped many of the top performing education systems in important ways to establish rigorous, focused and coherent content at all grade levels; reduce overlap in curricula across grades; reduce variation in implemented curricula across classrooms; and facilitate co-ordination of various policy drivers ranging from curricula to teacher training. Countries have often coupled the establishment of standards with devolving responsibility to the frontline, encouraging responsiveness to local needs. The United States is, of course, a decentralized education system too, but while many systems have decentralized decisions concerning the delivery of educational services while keeping tight control over the definition of outcomes, the design of curricula, standards and testing, the United States is different in that it has decentralized both inputs and control over outcomes. Moreover, while the United States has devolved responsibilities to local authorities, schools themselves have less discretion in decisionmaking than is the case in many OECD countries.
#+END_QUOTE

There seems to be a paradox in the US education policy system where in an, at least nominally, decentralized structure, schools have less autonomy than in other more centralized education systems.

# Descriptive stats
The descriptive statistics of the QDA codings of the Presidential documents confirms the pre-eminence given to the achievement testing of the students in the public schools.  The code for the testing of students (/StudentAssess/) is ranked second (349) after the code for school reform (425, /SchoolReform/, Table \ref{tbl:pres-docs-number-codings}).  The code /StudentAssess/ appears in 108 of the 127 documents, only two less documents than /SchoolReform/ (Table \ref{tbl:pres-docs-files-code}).  The cross-codes table confirms the close relationship between school reform and student assessment by the fact that /StudentAssess/ most closely overlaps with /SchoolReform/ (Table \ref{tbl:pres-docs-cross-code}).

The situation is similar for the Congressional hearings.  The code for student assessment ranks 4th and the one for school reform ranks 2nd (Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-number-codings}).  The student testing QDA code appears in 83 hearings out of 97 and is only second to the code for the AGs (Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-files-code}).  The cross-table shows a lower association of student assessment with school reform and a higher association with student achievement and the AGs (Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-cross-code}).  This is due to the fact that the majority of the Presidential documents are by President Bush, who insisted on tying school reform to student testing.  In contrast the congressional hearings offer a large variety of views where and thus a higher correlation with other concepts.

# text mining
The text mining of the President documents shows that the term 'measur' (stemmed), which in the rhetoric of President Bush is a proxy for student assessment ranks number 8 among the most frequent terms (Table \ref{tbl:pres-docs-freq-terms}).  The terms 'results' and 'scores' (unstemmed) rank 25th and 33rd, and the stemmed term 'rais', corresponding to e.g. 'raise' and 'raising' ranks 49th.

In the Congressional hearings the stemmed term 'assess' ranks 21st and 'measur' (stemmed) ranks 37th (Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-freq-terms}).

*** STRT Control and Accountability				     :subsec:
#<<discussion-dim-3-control-account>>
The testing of students and the later assessment of teachers has to be understood within an larger administrative framework that is usually called "accountability."  The test scores have to be recorded and distributed.  The data goes into computer systems, reports have to be written and sent to state and federal education departments.  Parents have to be informed.  Complex /calculations/ are also made to assess the schools themselves.  In NCLB each year for  each school it has to be determined whether it has or has not demonstrated *Adequate Yearly Progress*. States have to demonstrate to the federal department of education that all NCLB requirements are met.  At the other end, in Washington, a structure has to be created to read and respond to this large amount of data and information.  One can imagine the increase in administrative complexity that this all entails and the resistance of the 'periphery' to this 'central' demand.

# WCPD-1999-05-31-Pg964
#
President William Clinton made in May 1999 a proposal for ESEA reauthorization that prefigured NCLB in many respects including school accountability (WCPD-1999-05-31-Pg964, Table \ref{tbl:docs-clinton}).  The law "would require States to hold school districts and schools accountable for student performance against State standards, including helping the lowest-performing students continually to improve." In the same paragraph is mentioned the reason for this type of accountability, "narrowing the gap in achievement between disadvantaged students and their more affluent peers."  It is interesting that the only AG mentioned is the one based on income and no mention is made of race or ethnicity, gender, or proficiency in the English language.  The bill was referred to the House Committee on Education and the Workforce where it died.  It had 43 co-sponsors, all of the Democratic Party (http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/106/hr1960), but the Democratic House Representative co-author of NCLB, George Miller, was not among them.

# WCPD-2001-01-29-Pg217
#
Less then two years later (2001-01-23) President Bush would talk about accountability and educational control in a different way.  President Clinton simply mentioned accountability without any explicit mention to local control, but George Bush would stress this concept when he said "If local schools do not have the freedom to change, they cannot be held accountable for failing to change. Authority and accountability must be aligned at the local level," (WCPD-2001-01-29-Pg217).  Why this difference?  Maybe to appease a more conservative constituency that would have been more sensitive to the US policy tradition of local control education.

# WCPD-2003-01-13-Pg39
#
Again two years later (2003-01-08) the president would join accountability with local control with "high standards, accountability, and local control" (WCPD-2003-01-13-Pg39).  Later in the same discourse he would pair accountability with federal funding and stress its large amount.  In a business transaction it is certainly fair to ask for something "In return for a lot of money".

# WCPD-2004-05-17-Pg856
#
In a speech given to local politicians and school administrators (2004-05-11, WCPD-2004-05-17-Pg856) the president said "You need local control of schools so people who are making those decisions are accountable to the parents and the local citizens."  We see here a 'local-accountability-local' sandwich structure. Also notice that no hint is given about being accountable towards the central government.  In this speech the president acknowledges the criticism of NCLB being an "unfunded mandate to put accountability systems in place."  He reject this criticism, but makes a concession by using the language of "largely funded by the Federal Government."  Largely is not completely, and even a small percentage can be a burden on a state budget.  Why this, albeit small, concession? Probably the criticism has some validity.  A few months later the president would twice state "We believe in accountability. We believe in local control of schools." (WCPD-2004-08-16-Pg1561 and WCPD-2004-08-23-Pg1631).  This language is repeated in WCPD-2004-09-06-Pg1720, "We increased Federal funding, but we increased local control of schools and accountability across America so not one child is left behind in this country.", in WCPD-2004-09-06-Pg1773 "demanding high standards, accountability, and local control of schools.", and WCPD-2004-09-13-Pg1839-2, "accountability system to figure out who needs help early, before it's too late. We believe in local control of schools. We know reading is the new civil right."  Notice how in the last statement the practice of accountability is buffered by appeals to the welfare of the children and social justice.

The president will make two more electoral speeches in Fall 2004 where he will speak about accountability is this fashion.  Accountability in return for funding and for the benefit of the children, and he will stress local control (WCPD-2004-09-27-Pg2085, WCPD-2004-09-27-Pg2097). When the law had to be re-authorized and after being re-elected the president will continue to underline that accountability is not a federal intrusion, but rather a local endeavour

As is to be expected, this discourse on accountability is not very different from his Secretary of Education.  Margaret Spelling was invited to present at a House hearing on K-12 mathematics and science education (109hhrg27978, 2006-03-30, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-house} and Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-109hhrg27978}).  As we can read in the following excerpt the themes of President Bush on accountability are present

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Schools are being held accountable for results. Parents have more information and choices. And states have more flexibility to spend federal K-12 education resources, which have increased by 41 percent since 2001.
#+END_QUOTE

The president is willing to admit that the accountability system, even though 'local' is not working as it should.  He said to a group of teachers and parent in 2007-04-24

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
when Republicans and Democrats take a look at this bill, I strongly urge them to not weaken the bill, not to backslide, not to say, accountability isn't that important. It is important. We'll work with the school districts on flexibility when it comes to the accountability system. And I mean that there are certain ways that we can make this -- the accountability system actually work better than it's worked in the past. (WCPD-2007-04-30-Pg515)
#+END_QUOTE

However, that has not wavered his resolve to strong accountability to the federal government.  In 2009-01-08 the president stated "Local schools remain under local control. In exchange for Federal dollars, however, we expect results. ... we hold schools accountable for meeting the standards." (WCPD-2009-01-12-Pg22-3)

The text mining analysis confirm the close relationship between accountability and NCLB.  In the Congressional hearings the terms most closely related to 'account', the stemmed equivalent of accountability are 'system' (0.31), 'held' (0.24), and 'nclb' (0.23, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-assoc-account}, see also Figure \ref{fig:congr-hearings-dic-account}).  Such a close relationship does not appear in the Presidential documents, but the term 'weaken' (0.19, Table \ref{tbl:pres-docs-assoc-account}, see also Figure \ref{fig:pres-docs-dic-account}) refers to President Bush's appeal not to weaken the accountability requirements of NCLB (see Subsection [[discussion-dim-1-procedures][5.2.2]]).

*** STRT Control and School interventions 			     :subsec:
#<<discussion-dim-3-control-intervention>>
A more incisive aspect of the /administrative state/ in the problematic of the achievement gaps are the increasingly more drastic interventions in the change, or reform, of certain schools that are specified by NCLB.  These interventions range from extra funding all the way to the dismissal of faculty, management and staff and even permanent closure of the school itself (See figures \ref{fig:pres-docs-cid-21-24-39} and \ref{fig:congr-hearings-cid-21-24-39}).

In the initial statements about this aspect of NCLB President Bush used very veiled terms in conjunction with affirmations of local control.  On 2001-01-23 a couple of weeks after the signing of NCLB the president stated "If local schools do not have the freedom to change, they cannot be held accountable for failing to change." (WCPD-2001-01-29-Pg217, Table \ref{tbl:docs-bush}, see [[qda-searches-control-intervention][Appendix Section R.12]]) Thus, it is the schools that change themselves in they way that they deem appropriate. About three years later, on 2004-08-11, the language is slightly more incisive "We believe in local control of schools. We believe in challenging schools that refuse to change and refuse to teach." (WCPD-2004-08-16-Pg1561) Notice that a restatement of local control is countered, albeit only implicitly, by an affirmation of central control.  This affirmation is given in a very oblique fashion using the terms 'believe' and 'challenge'.  The action is justified by using language that implies a stubborn refusal to help children.  We have the rhetorical structure 'local-central-reason'.  Similar language is used a few days later on 2004-08-17, "And when we find schools that will not teach and will not change, we're bold enough to challenge the status quo." (WCPD-2004-08-23-Pg1631)  The president would reuse this type of discourse in the following month (WCPD-2004-09-06-Pg1750, WCPD-2004-09-06-Pg1757, and WCPD-2004-09-06-Pg1773).

However, not all authors used such type of indirect language.  For instance Joel Klein, the Chancellor of New York City public schools system said the following during a House hearing titled "NCLB: Can growth models ensure improved education for all students?" held on 2006-07-27 (109hhrg28839, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-house} and Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-109hhrg28839})

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Mayor Bloomberg and I have been very tough on accountability. We eliminated social promotion in our elementary and middle schools. We shut down failing high schools. We created "Empowerment Schools," schools whose principals receive greater autonomy in exchange for entering specific performance contracts agreeing to be held accountable for results. More than 300 principals volunteered, knowing that they could lose their jobs if they were unable to raise student achievement.
#+END_QUOTE

How could we explain this difference in tone?  Joel Klein had the full support of Mayor Michael Bloomberg (Republican).  The office of New York mayor had acquired control of the NYC school system from the State in 2000.  His affirmations of local authority were in line with the US policy tradition.  In addition it should be noted that Joel Klein is not a education professional, but a lawyer and that he is applying neo-liberal policies.

The following year, in 2007, the president gave three speeches where he acknowledges that this provision of NCLB is becoming very controversial. President Bush stated that "principals ought to be given additional staffing freedom" (WCPD-2007-04-30-Pg515)  That is en euphemism for the dismissal of teachers.  Also he said "I know some Members and Senators have got concerns about the law .... for the sake of the country, for the sake of kids who deserve better, we expect you to change." (WCPD-2007-07-02-Pg858)  Similarly, Peter McWalters, Commissioner of Elementary and Secondary Education, State of Rhode Island stated during stated during a House hearing (110hhrg34015, 2007-03-21, Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-house} and Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-messages-110hhrg34015}) that the House of Representatives for its re-authorization of ESEA

The following president, Mr. Barack Obama, took distance from the type of discourse of his predecessor.  For instance, he said on 2009-07-24 "Change will come from the bottom up." (DCPD-200900595) Not even a hint is given of any type of federal or even state intervention. In a similar discourse a few months later (2009-11-04) the president gives a hierarchical ladder that only reaches up to the school district, the threshold of what can still be accepted as 'local control'.  He said

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Now, that's how teachers can determine what they should be doing differently in the classroom. That's how principals can determine what changes need to be made in our schools. And that's how school districts can determine what they need to be doing better to prepare our teachers and principals.
#+END_QUOTE

In the next paragraph the president even refers to socio-economic conditions of the local school, that would overwhelm the capacity of even the most capable and dedicated educators, which is  something that his predecessor has not done

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
here are some schools that are starting in a tough position: a lot of kids coming from impoverished backgrounds; a lot of kids coming in that may have not gotten the kind of head start that they needed; they start school already behind. And even though there are heroic teachers and principals in many of these schools, the fact is that they need some extra help.
#+END_QUOTE

However, then a completely different rationale appears that is in contradiction with what has just been said

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We'll look at whether they're willing to remake a school from top to bottom with new leaders and a new way of teaching, replacing a school's principal if it's not working and at least half its staff, close a school for a time and then reopen it under new management, even shut down the school entirely and send its students to a better school nearby.
#+END_QUOTE

This statement is quite unexpected, especially considering that the audience was a middle school. Not even President Bush was so explicit.  In the following year (2010-07-29) the president would make a much more conciliatory statement

#+END_QUOTE

President Obama tries to distance himself from NCLB even though the provisions of RTTT are actually more stringent and drastic than NCLB.  It seems that political affiliation does not really matter.  The /administrative state/ appears to have a life of its own and keeps on growing.

The above mentioned speech mentions charter schools as an option for school restructuring.  One could consider the conversion of a school from traditional to charter to be a retreat of the /administrative state/.  Indeed, these are administratively independent schools and are a form of privatization.  However, this phenomenon has to be understood within the framework of Foucault's first definition of /governmentality/. Namely, as part of the /technology of the self/, where the government relies of self-control and personal responsabilisation of the individual to conduct the affairs of the state (see [[lit-review-governmentality][Section 2.4]] page \pageref{lit-review-governmentality} and [[discussion-dim-1][Section 5.2]], page \pageref{discussion-dim-1}).

# descriptive statistics
The de-emphasis of the punitive aspects in the political discourse on education reform is confirmed by the low ranking of the related QDA codes, /SchoolFixClose/, /SchoolCharter/, and /TeacherReplace/ (see figures \ref{fig:pres-docs-cid-21-24-39} and \ref{fig:congr-hearings-cid-21-24-39}).  In the Presidential documents collection the first code is ranked 28, the second one 32, and the last one 35 (Table \ref{tbl:pres-docs-number-codings}). The situation is similar for the number of documents that contain these QDA codes (Table \ref{tbl:pres-docs-files-code} and Table \ref{tbl:congr-hearings-files-code}).

# Grave deficiencies in American K-12 math-science education have been documented in many prominent reports; e.g., /A Nation at Risk/ (1983), /Shaping the Future/ (1996), TIMSS (1998), /Glenn Commission/ (2000), PISA (2006). Despite these high profile warnings and recommendations, the problems of math-science education have continued to deepen toward a crisis, as expressed by another blue-ribbon committee with the warning: "If America is to sustain its international competitiveness, its national security, and quality of life for its citizens, then it must move quickly to achieve significant improvements of all students in mathematics and science." (Business-Higher Education Forum, 2005).

# education - library model
# AGs, ignore the IAG as (1) secondary to NAG and (2) irrelevant.

# Schools do not operate according to the neoliberal, free market forces,
# because public schools do not compete for students.  Private schools and
# tutoring services do and universities do, but not public schools
# in addition there is not supply/demand balance in education and health because

# the job market, school culture, teacher quality, social implications, and so on

# the AGs as a catalyst for discourse contrast between local/central, type of
# accountability, ....

# No one questions whether the AGs exists.  No one questions whether the

[fn:29] See \citeA[pp. 2--4]{Ball:1990b} for an introduction on Foucault and discourse with an application to education.

[fn:30] Deconstruction is actually a concept introduced by Jacques Derrida (1930-2004) who studied text with a different methodology that Foucault's. Even a brief explanation of the similarities and differences is outside of the scope of this essay.

[fn:31] the correspondence theory of truth

[fn:32] Naples, 1668-1744, wrote "the true and the made are \ldots convertible" /verum et factum convertuntur/) and "the true is precisely what is made." /verum esse ipsum factum/) \cite{SEP:2009a}.

[fn:33] The conceptual devices I am referring are the experimental and quasi-experimental designs.

[fn:43] Interestingly, the first time that we have actual public support for teaching, including mathematics, is in the Italian city-states or its small republics.

[fn:44] http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/search/home.action In 1993, Congress passed the U.S. Government Printing Office Electronic Information Access Enhancement Act (Public Law 103-40), which expanded GPO's mission to provide electronic access to Federal electronic information. In June 1994, GPO launched GPO Access, which provides online access to information from all three branches of the Federal Government. For more than 15 years, GPO Access has been America's source for Government information online, but now GPO is unveiling the next generation of Government information online with GPO's Federal Digital System (FDsys).

[fn:66] Exceptions known to me are Philistia and Normandy.  The conquering Philistines and Vikings took the language of the conquered.  This probably happened because the invaders were mainly males who married local women.  The mothers would teach their own language to their children.  By the time that the Normans invaded England they spoke French and not Danish.  All Philistine inscriptions found are in Canaaitic, not Greek. Sometimes the conquerors do not want the conquered to speak the language of the winners to keep them at a disadvantage.   See again the Normans in England.  Sometimes the élite would speak a foreign language for the same reason.  For instance, the Russian nobility would speak French so that their Russian subject would not understand them.

[fn:67] That is why the title of the dissertation has /Gaps/ instead of /Gap/.

[fn:70] The list of these countries varies over time, at the beginning they were Germany and the UK, then Japan and the USSR, more recently it is Western Europe, China and South Korea.  It is more a function of economic competition and trade imbalance than actual ranking on international studies.  Finland, Canada, Australia and New Zealand are consistently ranked higher, but are rarely mentioned in articles and commentaries on the Achievement Gap.

[fn:73] Recently technology has increased the chance of survival of an immigrant's original language. Satellite TV and the Internet allows hundreds of languages to be heard in homes in the U.S.A..

[fn:74] Ironically, Spanish is allowed in schools as a "foreign" language, even though it was the original and official language of all states in the Southwest US plus Texas and Florida.

[fn:78] The first and third sentences are attributed to Socrates, the second to Glaucon. Of course, this is all a literary device.

[fn:79] Here I focus on mathematics

[fn:80] What is meant here is that mathematics has no cultural or ethnic barriers.  It does create again an inside-outside bifurcation which has profound financial and social implications.  It creates a sort of /intellectual nobility/ that mostly replaces the previous /blood nobility/.  Mathematical skills combined with polished and cultivated speech and writing are the connotations of today's élite (see \citeNP{Bourdieu:1982a} and \citeNP{Bourdieu:1990a}).

[fn:81] This is however not required for applicants over a certain age.

[fn:82] Notice the order in "value and beauty".

[fn:83] Religious affiliation is usually mandatory on all identification documents and only certain religions are allowed by the government. This creates legal problems for citizens who do not belong to any of the 'official' religions.

[fn:88] Previously the term "English as a second language" was used.  I suppose it is not acceptable to consider English anything but the first language. Thus, it is the first language or just "not yet" the first language with the understanding that the person is doing its very best to become proficient and not to use any other language in preference to English.

[fn:89] Socrates: 
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The error was just as if some one who wanted to divide the human race, were to divide them after the fashion which prevails in this part of the world; here they cut off the Hellenes as one species, and all the other species of mankind, which are innumerable, and have no ties or common language, they include under the single name of "barbarians," and because they have one name they are supposed to be of one species also. Or suppose that in dividing numbers you were to cut off ten thousand from all the rest, and make of it one species, comprehending the first under another separate name, you might say that here too was a single class, because you had given it a single name. Whereas you would make a much better and more equal and logical classification of numbers, if you divided them into odd and even; or of the human species, if you divided them into male and female; and only separated off Lydians or Phrygians, or any other tribe, and arrayed them against the rest of the world, when you could no longer make a division into parts which were also classes.

Translated by Benjamin Jowett, http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/stateman.html

[fn:90] I am not arguing here whether the U.S.A. is a classless society or not. I do think that it is in all societies be they technologically advanced or primitive, capitalist or communist, but that is not my point here.  I take the myth at face value. A significant proportion of the population in the U.S.A. thinks that it is, or in any case it is part and parcel of the dominant political and cultural discourse in the country.  Any perfunctory examination of election campaign material will quickly detect this.  One of the sobering aspects of the Katrina has been that it has shown the myth of the classless society for what it is, a vague collective desire at best and a cruel farce at worst.

[fn:91] Later in the story Huck will acknowledge that Jim was after all his equal.  Ironically, they both were equally poor, homeless, and ignorant.

[fn:92] It is ironic to notice that it is politically correct to mock an Afro-American or Hispanic for the way that he or she speaks, but it is not acceptable to do so on the way that the person's physical appearance.

* DONE Text formatting & Scrubbing 				    :chp:app:
#<<app-scrub>>
The scripts in this chapter performed generic and file specific text scrubbing. The generic part was the removal of redundant lines common to the specific document collection.  In addition, these scripts performed file-specific "scrubbing" of the files.  The original files were preserved for checking.  The statements were 'extracted' and placed in a file with the same name except for the ".scrb" extension.

These /bash/ UNIX scripts perform the operations corresponding to the step "remove redundant text" of the work flow diagram (\ref{fig:workflow-detail}, page \pageref{fig:workflow-detail}).

The =congr-hearings= and =pres-docs= documents required some manual editing.

** DONE Presidential documents						:sec:
#<<app-scrub-pres-docs>>
The following script remove redundant lines from the Presidential Documents.  There is no file-specific scrubbing.  Files starting with WCPD in their file name have line breaks at the end of each line and thus have no proper paragraph formatting.  I had to manually reconstruct the paragraphs using an Emacs function.

In this appendix are the /R/ scripts and commands used to (1) create the /RQDA/ project, (2) open the project, (3) load the text from the scrubbed files, (4) apply a file category id to the files in the project, and (4) add a description of the project.

The file category is only relevant if we have different types of files in the same project.  This is not the case in this research. I have only implemented this feature for completeness. Table \ref{tbl:file-categories} on page \pageref{tbl:file-categories} was used by the /R/ scripts to implement this feature.

To see the loaded file attributes start /R/, then /RQDA/, and open the /RQDA/ project and click on the "attributes" tab. you will see the loaded attributes in alphabetic order. It is also possible to check the file attributes by entering at the /R/ prompt the following statement after having opened the /RQDA/ project

#+srcname: check-attributes
#+begin_src R
RQDAQuery("select name, memo from attributes where status==1 and memo like 'File:%'")
#+end_src

See each document collection section for details.  These /R/ scripts perform the operations corresponding to the step "Apply attributes to file" of the work flow diagram (\ref{fig:workflow-detail}, page \pageref{fig:workflow-detail}).

\ref{tbl:attributes} on page \pageref{tbl:attributes} is the table with file attributes in upper panel and case attributes in lower panel.  This table was used by /R/ scripts to populate the project database table "attributes" as can be seen in the /R/ scripts themselves.  For case attributes refer to [[app-case-attr][Appendix G]].

This appendix contains the /R/ scripts that were used to (partially) populate the statement/case specific database tables, 'caseAttr', 'caselinkage', and 'cases'.

The statement (case) attributes can be displayed by entering the following commands at the /R/ prompt

#+begin_src R

sql  <- "select name from attributes where memo like 'Case:%' and status = 1'"

#+end_src

where <project> is the name of the project and <case attribute> is the name of one of the case attributes (surrounded by double quotes).

** DONE Presidential documents						:sec:
#<<app-case-attr-pres-docs>>

In the =pres-docs= collection each document corresponds to a single statement and thus corresponds to a single case. The case attributes were already loaded into the "attributes" table together with the file attributes. 

Note that document WCPD-2004-10-18-Pg2364 is a debate between President George Bush and Senator John Kerry and is thus the exception in having 2 statements.

The only attribute that can be assigned automatically are the "CaseDate" because that corresponds to the "DocDate".

To add the case attributes to the "caseAttr", "cases", and "caselinkage" tables in this /RQDA/ project type the following at the /R/ prompt

#+begin_src R

** DONE Congressional hearings						:sec:
#<<app-case-attr-congr-hearings>>
In the =congr-hearings= collection each document contains more than one statement, each with its own author.  This being the situation, nothing can be automated.  Cases were assigned according to the instructions on http://rqda.r-forge.r-project.org/documentation_2.html#manual.  Then, values were assigned to Case Attributes manually using the GUI.

* DONE Summary results of statement analysis in /RQDA/		    :chp:app:
#<<app-case-summary>>
In this chapter are the scripts used to provide summary statistics of the statement descriptions.  I used SQL (structured query language) to obtain this data.

* COMP Apply QDA codes to paragraphs in /RQDA/			    :chp:app:
#<<app-qda-codes>>
The following /R/ commands will "clean" the /RQDA/ project by removing all unused files, codes, code categories, and cases.

#+begin_src R
library("RQDA")
openProject("~/Dropbox/dissertation/data/<project>.rqda", updateGUI = TRUE)
CleanProject()
#+end_src

Note that it is also possible to do so through the /RQDA/ GUI.

In the /RQDA/ GUI the theme/code connections are graphically displayed by right-clicking a code category and selecting "plot selected code categories".

First we add the codes to the database. It is possible to check the available codes for a certain /RQDA/ project by clicking on the "codes" tab in the GUI or by entering the following at the /R/ prompt

#+srcname: check-codes
#+begin_src R
library("RQDA")
openProject("~/Dropbox/dissertation/data/<project>.rqda", updateGUI = TRUE)
RQDAQuery("select id, name, memo from freecode where status==1")

# C-c C-v t to generate the R script
# C-c C-c to run the bash script
The /R/ script loads the code categories (themes) in the =pres-docs= project database from the file =themes.tsv=, then loads the codes from =codes.tsv= and assigns them to their category. Finally it tentatively applies them to paragraphs or lines of the source documents using word patterns from =code-patterns.tsv=. When coding I ignored the questions in a question-and-answer setting.

To run the script type the following at the /R/ prompt

#+begin_src R

* STRT Summary results of QDA codes in /RQDA/			    :chp:app:
#<<app-codes-summary>>
# C-c C-v t to generate scripts

In this appendix are the scripts that created several descriptive statistics of the *QDA* codes as described in [[method-detailed-steps-J][Subsection 3.5.10]].  /RQDA/ provides /R/ functions that allow you to calculate and generate *QDA* inter-code relationships and *QDA* code summaries.  I build on those functions to create frequency tables and time charts.

The graphs contain a "smoothing curve".  This curve was generated using the LOESS method of smoothing.  See http://research.stowers-institute.org/efg/R/Statistics/loess.htm

I have divided the /R/ code into two scripts.  The first one created some frequency tables and produces the graphs.  The second one produces the cross-codes table and is computationally intensive.

** STRT Presidential documents 						:sec:
#<<app-codes-summary-pres-docs>>

To calculate the coding descriptive statistics for the =pres-docs= project type the following at the /R/ prompt

#+begin_src R
library("RQDA")
openProject("~/Dropbox/dissertation/data/pres-docs.rqda", updateGUI = TRUE)
setwd("~/Dropbox/dissertation/data")
source("codes-summary-pres-docs.R")
source("cross-codes-pres-docs.R")
#+end_src

#+begin_latex
\noindent
#+end_latex
This will run the following /R/ script.  

#+srcname: codes-summary-pres-docs

* COMP Create /tm/ corpora from /RQDA/				    :chp:app:
#<<app-rqda2tm>>
# "C-c C-v t" to generate the R scripts
This appendix contains the /R/ scripts that I wrote to export the coded paragraphs from /RQDA/ to create a /tm/ corpus.

To obtain the description of the corpus and its metadata for a specific document collection type the following at the /R/ prompt

#+begin_src R
library("tm")
setwd("~/Dropbox/dissertation/data")
summary(corpus)
meta(corpus)
meta(corpus[1])
#+end_src

#+begin_latex
\noindent
#+end_latex

The first meta command will display the metadata for all files in the corpus.  The second command will do so for only file 1.  The /R/ code will only create two categories of metadata: (1) the /RQDA/ file id, and (2) the file name.  Other possible metadata categories are the document author and document date.  However, for the type of text mining analysis that I performed these pieces of information were not necessary.

** DONE Presidential documents						:sec:
#<<app-rqda2tm-pres-docs>>

To create the =pres-docs= corpus start /R/ and type the following at the prompt

#+begin_src R
library("RQDA")
library("tm")
setwd("~/Dropbox/dissertation/data")
openProject("~/Dropbox/dissertation/data/pres-docs.rqda", updateGUI = TRUE)
source("rqda2tm-pres-docs.R")
#+end_src

#+begin_latex
\noindent
#+end_latex
This will run the following /R/ script that will convert the /RQDA/ codings into a /tm/ corpus.

#+srcname: rqda2tm-pres-docs
#+begin_src R :tangle ~/Dropbox/dissertation/data/rqda2tm-pres-docs.R

* COMP Process /tm/ corpora					    :chp:app:
#<<app-process>>
This appendix contains the /R/ scripts that were used to process the two corpora that were created by the scripts contained in [[app-rqda2tm][Appendix K]].

I ran these scripts on my personal computer while developing the /R/ code.  However, for production purposes they were transferred to =brazos.tamu.edu= at Texas A&M University and run on it remotely.

The processing consists of a series of steps that were run in sequence: (1) load corpus from file, (2) convert to lower case, (3) convert full names to acronyms, (4) convert variants to single form, (5) remove generic stop words, (6) remove stop words defined by myself, (7) conversion of some relevant synonyms to a single form, (8) removal of numbers, (9) removal of punctuation, (10) removal of white space.  At this point I have what I called an "unstemmed processed corpus".  This was saved to file. Then I performed the final stem, the stemming.  This would yield a "stemmed processed corpus", which also would be saved to a file.  Both files were then downloaded to my personal computer for analysis.

* COMP Text mine /tm/ corpora					    :chp:app:
#<<app-tm>>
# C-c C-v t to create the R scripts

This appendix contains the /R/ scripts for the text mining of the two /corpora/ that were created by the /R/ scripts contained in the previous appendix ([[app-process][L]]).  For an explanation of how they operate see [[method-detailed-steps-M][Subsection 3.5.11]].  Be aware that the computations for the associations in the Congressional hearings and the creation of the dendrograms takes a considerable amount of time.

** STRT Presidential documents						:sec:
#<<app-tm-pres-docs>>

To perform the text mining on the =pres-docs= project type the following commands at the /R/ prompt

#+begin_src R
setwd("~/Dropbox/dissertation/data")
source("tm-pres-docs.R")
#+end_src

#+begin_latex
\noindent
#+end_latex
This will run the following script

* COMP Brazos Computer Cluster					    :chp:app:
#<<app-brazos>>

Computationally intensive /R/ text mining processing script were run on =brazos.tamu.edu= a computer cluster managed by the Brazos Computational Resource at Texas A&M University. For details see http://brazos.tamu.edu.

1. The /R/ data files are kept in the directory ~/Data
2. The batch program is run by entering the following command:

#+begin_src sh
qsub -q general -m abe congr-hearings-1.pbs
qsub -q general -m abe pres-docs-1.pbs
#+end_src

Which runs the following bath file for the Presidential documents

#+begin_src sh
#PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=8
#PBS -l walltime=05:00:00
#PBS -l mem=16GB
#PBS -q general

# run: qsub -q general -m abe pres-docs-1.pbs

. /etc/profile.d/modules.sh
module load r/2.14.1/gcc/64

cd $HOME
R CMD BATCH /home/hindiogine/pres-docs-process.R

wait
exit 0
#+end_src

and the following for Congressional hearings

#+begin_src sh
#PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=8
#PBS -l walltime=60:00:00
#PBS -l mem=16GB
#PBS -q general

# run: qsub -q general -m abe congr-hearings-1.pbs

. /etc/profile.d/modules.sh
module load r/2.14.1/gcc/64

cd $HOME
R CMD BATCH /home/hindiogine/congr-hearings-process.R

wait
exit 0
#+end_src

3. The files =congr-hearings-process.R= and =pres-docs-process.R= are transferred by =scp= to the computer cluster and then slightly edited to conform to the local directories.

4. Once the job has started one can check its status by entering =qstat -u hindiogine=.

More info is obtained by entering: =qstat -f JobID=

5. To terminate a job enter  =qsig -s 15 JobID=.  Use =qstat= to find out the job id.

6. To install a /R/ library:

#+begin_src sh
module avail
module load java/sun-jre-1.6
module load r/2.14.1/gcc/64
R
install.packages("tm")
install.packages("Snowball")
#+end_src

* COMP Software installation					    :chp:app:
#<<app-software>>

I used the following computer programs for my work: GNU Emacs (http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), LaTeX (http://www.latex-project.org/), and R-project (http://www.r-project.org). These programs can be installed using the normal guidelines for the operating system. However, there are /R/ libraries that need to be added to the default installation. They are =tm= for text mining and =RQDA= for qualitative data analysis.

First install the /R/ packages from the normal repository using, in my situation, apt-get

#+begin_src sh
sudo apt-get install r-base \
                     r-recommended \
                     r-base-dev \
                     r-doc-pdf \
                     r-mathlib \
                     r-cran-odbc \
                     r-cran-rsprng \
                     r-cran-rpvm \
                     r-cran-rmpi \
                     gdal-bin \
                     mpi-default-dev \
                     libgeos-dev \
                     xml2 \
                     libxml2-dev \
                     libglu1-mesa-dev \
                     libgtk2.0-dev \
                     graphviz-dev \
                     gtk2-engines-pixbuf \
                     sqlite3 \
                     sqlite3-doc
#+end_src

Make sure that you have a Java JDK also installed. Then, start /R/ as administrator and type at the prompt

#+begin_src R
install.packages("tm", dependencies=TRUE)
install.packages("ggplot2", dependencies=TRUE)
install.packages("RGtk2", dependencies=TRUE)
install.packages("gWidgetsRGtk2", dependencies=TRUE)
install.packages("ecodist", dependencies=TRUE)
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("Rgraphviz")
#+end_src

I wanted to use the bleeding edge version of /RQDA/.  I downloaded it from the developer repository using the following commands

#+begin_src sh
cd ~/Downloads
rm -rf rqda
svn checkout svn://svn.r-forge.r-project.org/svnroot/rqda
#+end_src

The last line on screen will inform you of the revision number (presently 493).  Then log into R as root and enter

#+begin_src R
install.packages("/home/henk/Downloads/rqda/pkg/RQDA", repos = NULL, type = "source")
quit()
#+end_src

To install /Emacs/, the software application that integrates data analysis and text writing, I entered the following commands

#+begin_src sh
apt-get install auctex bbdb emacs-goodies-el emacs-snapshot ess
#+end_src

For the installation of Dropbox I used the following commands

#+begin_src sh
cd ~ && wget -O - "https://www.dropbox.com/download?plat=lnx.x86" | tar xzf -
~/.dropbox-dist/dropboxd
#+end_src

Refer to https://www.dropbox.com/install?os=lnx for details.

This appendix contains the tables that present the statement main messages of the source documents.  These tables are too voluminous to be placed in the main text.  Often they are snippets of quotations and sometimes they are my abstraction of the text.  The purpose of this appendix is to provide an idea of the content of the source documents.

| Deborah       | The issue in Oakland is not money it is management who fails to hire  |

| Maxine Waters | The poor academic achievement level of African-American children in   |
|               | Oakland, and indeed in many American communities, requires parents,   |

| Michael D. | The Council supported the legislation because it set the right   |
| Casserly   | goals and it focused on the right kids -- those too often left   |
|            | behind. We also endorsed the legislation because Congress        |
|            | generously funded the Act in the first year and targeted the     |
|            | resources on communities that needed help the most.              |

| Eric J.  | The No Child Left Behind Act has transformed the debate about public   |
| Smith    | education in America from blaming societal issues outside of schools'  |
|          | control to a focus on what we do control -- our ability to teach every |
|          | child to rigorous standards.                                           |
|----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| George   | to address these problems and provide the Secretary with this          |
| Miller   | authority, Senator Kennedy and I introduced the NCLB Fairness Act last |
|          | week. It gives schools the flexibility to have their AYP for last year |
|          | recalculated based on the Department's guidance on children with       |
|          | disabilities and limited English skills.                               |
|----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| John A.  | As other states release their test data, we're seeing similar proof    |
| Boehner  | that student achievement is on the rise and achievement gaps are       |
|          | closing.                                                               |

| Michael  | The public should no longer wonder whether urban education can be      |
| D.       | saved. It can. The public should no longer worry about whether         |
| Casserly | student achievement can be raised. It will be.                         |
|----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Margaret | But in relative terms, when the effects of the pre-existing            |
| E.       | achievement gap and accountability are taken together, accountability  |
| Raymond  | is seen to mitigate but not reverse a widening of the achievement gap. |
|          | This is because whites gain more than blacks after accountability is   |
|          | introduced, so the racial achievement gap with blacks actually widens  |
|          | after the introduction of accountability.                              |
|----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Margaret | The Congressman raises an important question: while the details of     |
| E.       | NCLB at present focus on academic performance, an implicit assumption  |
| Raymond  | is that academic attainment should follow directly.                    |
|----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Marcus   | if we expect schools to be great, we should also expect government to  |
| J.       | be great. And businesses to be great.  And churches.  And most         |
| Newsome  | importantly, families.                                                 |
|----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Paul     | With this recognition comes our obligation to provide whatever         |
| G.       | resources we have to correct this historic imbalance, and the          |
| Vallas   | structure of the Act provides districts with the opportunity to do so. |

| Phillip  | We are concerned that No Child Left Behind may be used to    |
| Martin   | compare our children to other populations without accounting |
|          | for these factors.  The disproportionate socio-economic      |
|          | handicaps that tribal children and tribal school systems     |
|          | have had to face must be a part of the equation when         |
|          | examining performance and funding.                           |
|----------+--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Terry    | The primary effect of No Child Left Behind is to concentrate |
| Ben      | tribal and Federal attention on finding the most equitable   |
|          | way to distribute what is in fact inadequate funding.        |

| Victoria | We are confident that the new subgroup accountability        |
| Vasquez  | requirements, coupled with significant increases in funding  |
|          | for programs under the NCLB Act, will help close the         |

| Lamar       | I can think of no more important priority for our Nation than     |

|             | approved academic program of his or her parents' choice.          |
|-------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lamar       | If letting scholarships follow students to the colleges of their  |

| Paul        | American education today is beginning to have the transparency    |
| E.          | and accountability that it desperately needs. Properly designed,  |

| Woolsey    | underfunded the No Child Left Behind Act by $55 billion, and cut    |

| Howard    | Some have raised concerns about the reliability of the status      |
| P. McKeon | model and have suggested that a growth model would be more useful. |
|-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Joel I.   | But to criticize the heart of No Child Left Behind is to refuse to |

|-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Kati      | we have got to get beyond this never-ending quest for the perfect  |

| Marlene   | The model also measures whether achievement gaps are closing by    |

|                 | also clear to us that NCLB's teacher-quality provisions are only a  |

| Hai-Lung | A significant reason for allowing teachers who do not have sufficient   |

|          | American education philosophy, championed by the famous education       |
|          | philosopher John Dewey, that how one teaches is more important than     |

| James B.      | the United States faces a competitive challenge not only from foreign       |

|---------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Peter         | The reason for the decline is that after the 4th grade in the United States |
| O'Donnell Jr. | the number of new science and math concepts introduced is very low.         |
|---------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Tom           | The fact that the results are poor reflects that U.S. students are not      |
| Rudin         | learning this material very well. This relates more to the lack of          |
|               | preparation of middle school teachers in math content knowledge and their   |

|-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| Howard    | Adequate yearly progress is a benchmark that makes NCLB different from other      |
| P.        | education laws that came before it. ....  And for that reason, it is vital that   |
| McKeon    | the concept remains in place.                                                     |
|-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Linda     | the measures used to gauge school progress must motivate continuous improvement   |
| Darling-  | and attend to the range of school outcomes and conditions that are needed to      |
| Hammond   | ensure that all students are educated to higher levels.                           |
|-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Peter     | Congress to allow states to include additional relevant data in making judgements |
| McWalters | about school progress, allowing states to differentiate consequences for schools  |
|           | that have missed their annual targets, investing more in state capacity to assist |
|           | and intervene in districts and schools that have missed their targets, and        |
|           | creating a new process for innovative models and a greatly revised system of peer |
|           | review that would allow states to continuously innovate in accountability and     |
|           | other areas -- with proper guarantees for results.                                |
|-----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Valerie   | In order for states to pursue stronger, more robust systems of accountability, a  |
| Woodruff  | partnership of support and technical assistance must be in place. States need     |
|           | ongoing technical assistance in order to build a strong knowledge base about      |
|           | accountability models. They need to benefit from research about which models are  |
|           | most effective and why.  They need continuing support in development and          |
|           | improvement of data systems.                                                      |

| Cornelia  | For NCLB to reduce or to eliminate the achievement gaps that belie our Nation's   |

| Rebecca   | NCLB's greatest potential benefit to students with disabilities may depend on its   |
| H.        | ability to ensure strong general education programs that eliminate inappropriate    |

| Jane     | In today's world we, as education leaders, must communicate the message  |
| Norwood  | that a high school education -- a high school diploma -- has become a    |

|          | right, for all students. We have an obligation to protect this right.    |

| Maria    | In this country, not so long ago, it seemed unreasonable to think that   |

|----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Robert   | By appropriately extending its education focus to include the needs of   |
| Wise     | students in middle and high schools, the federal government can move the |

| George   | One of the very best ways we can close the achievement gap is to      |
| Miller   | close the teacher quality gap.                                        |

| Howard   | If we are truly serious about placing high-quality teachers in every  |
| P.       | American classroom, then this Committee must explore ways to include  |
| McKeon   | proposals addressing collective bargaining agreements in the          |
|          | re-authorization process.                                             |
|----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| John D.  | Not only are we failing to attract new teachers to the field; we are  |
| Podesta  | also failing to retain them.                                          |
|----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Joel I.  | schools no longer have to guess about teacher quality, either. It is  |
| Klein    | something we can and should measure. I hope the next version of NCLB  |
|          | will motivate schools to do this, just as we're doing it in New York  |
|          | City.                                                                 |

| Joseph   | A re-dedication to placing U.S. education number 1 in the world is    |
| P. Burke | critical to our economic and political future as a world leader. Our  |
|          | children deserve no less -- our citizens must have public policy that |
|          | places excellence and equity as centerpieces of education outcomes.   |
|----------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Jarvis   | We cannot have a healthy, vibrant America while so many of our        |
| Sanford  | children are truly left behind with no real options or tools to       |
|          | develop anything good for their future.                               |

| Linda    | The current accountability provisions of the Act .... create large    |
| Darling- | incentives for schools to keep students out and to hold back or push  |
| Hammond  | out students who are not doing well.                                  |

| Brian      | We are very concerned that American students are not achieving their  |
| Baird      | their potential in science and math education. This is a concern not  |
|            | only as we look at competing in a knowledge-based global economy, but |
|            | also when we look at access to high-paying, technology-based jobs in  |
|            | this country.                                                         |
|------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| House      | A multitude of studies over the past twenty years have documented the |
| Committee  | downward slide of American students' proficiency and participation in |
| Science &  | science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields.       |
| Technology |                                                                       |

| Author    | Message                                                                   |
|-----------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Chester   | In Washington, these debates about prescription versus flexibility and    |
| E. Finn   | the proper federal role quickly become ideological.                       |
|-----------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Carol     | I am a strong believer in flexibility and the accountability that should  |
| Johnson   | accompany it.                                                             |
|-----------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Eva L.    | Accountability tests have swung education strongly toward institutional   |
| Baker     | goals and away from those of the individual.                              |
|-----------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| John F.   | Even for subgroups that showed evidence of gaps narrowing, the gaps in    |
| Jennings  | percentages proficient often amounted to 20 percentage points or more,    |
|           | suggesting that it will take a concerted, long-term effort to close them. |
|-----------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Kathleen  | it is also our belief that modifications are necessary to the amendments  |
| N. Straus | made in the 2001 re-authorization.                                        |
|-----------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Linda     | The next important step is to ensure that the range of things schools and |
| Darling-  | states pay attention to actually helps them improve both the quality of   |
| Hammond   | education they offer to every student and the quality of the overall      |
|           | schooling enterprise.                                                     |
|-----------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Michael   | As I have said, I believe strongly in No Child Left Behind. The           |
| N.        | importance of closing the achievement gap cannot be overstated, and I     |
| Castle    | believe Mr. McKeon's bill will help states and local school districts     |
|           | close that gap even more quickly.                                         |
|-----------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Rick      | Flexibility should not be understood as bending the rules, but should     |
| Melmer    | rather be available whenever it makes the best educational sense for      |
|           | students.                                                                 |

| Antonia     | Parents, teachers, elected officials and others have called for substantive     |
| Cortese     | changes to NCLB. This draft does not appear to address those concerns           |
|             | adequately, and it is clear that more work needs to be done to fix the law's    |
|             | fundamental problems.                                                           |
|-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Andrea      | While significant improvements must be made to NCLB to achieve that goal, we    |
| Messina     | cannot afford to back away from our insistence on holding the same high         |
|             | expectations for all children paired with meaningful accountability for results |
|             | based on objective measures of progress.                                        |
|-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Adria       | There is no more critical goal than increasing the number of young people who   |
| Steinberg   | graduate from high school and ensuring that these graduates are ready for       |
|             | college and careers.                                                            |
|-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Brian       | the aspirational goal of 100% of the students proficient by 2013-14 is not a    |
| Gong        | credible goal. It is possible to define goals that will be challenging,         |
|             | rigorous, equitable, and possible.                                              |
|-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Barry       | We strongly urge you to commit to your nation's schools in budget as much as in |
| Stark       | law and ensure that the necessary level of funding is appropriated.             |
|-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Robert      | NCLB doesn't do much to address what is a significant crisis in this country    |
| Wise        | -- the millions of students who are leaving our high schools, with or without   |
|             | a diploma, unprepared for their future.                                         |
|-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Center for  | Raising the academic achievement of all students and eliminating the            |
| Educational | achievement gap for various groups of students must remain as national          |
| Policy      | priorities.                                                                     |
|-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Daniel J.   | We believe that the proposed revisions to NCLB should foster greater equity     |
| Losen       | in educational opportunity for American children, and substantially improve     |
|             | learning and graduation levels. With further improvements to the excellent      |
|             | beginnings in this draft, we believe that educators and communities across      |
|             | the country will find that their concerns have been heard along with new        |
|             | inspiration to help achieve its challenging goals.                              |
|-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| David L.    | We know that with adequate resources we can replicate the Banning Senior High   |
| Brewer III  | School model around the District, but we need Congress to pass a law that will  |
|             | provide the much needed flexibility, resources, and room to develop and         |
|             | implement innovative and proven programs.                                       |
|-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dianne M.   | We believe education is a fundamental civil right. We also believe that NCLB    |
| Piche       | represents our nation's most serious commitment at this time to closing our     |
|             | nation's persistent academic achievement gaps -- gaps that inflict enduring     |
|             | pain and injury on our most vulnerable children, their families and             |
|             | communities.                                                                    |
|-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Delia       | Gutting NCLB's accountability measures would be a major setback for members of  |
| Pompa       | Congress, advocates, educators, parents, and students hoping to build on this   |
|             | public will to improve our public schools.                                      |
|-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Frances     | the effective use of technology throughout education is critical to preparing   |
| Bryant      | our students for a global marketplace.                                          |
| Bradburn    |                                                                                 |

| George      | As a nation we are not offering teachers the respect and support they deserve,  |
| Miller      | and as a result we are facing a teacher shortage crisis.                        |
|-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Joan E.     | Our nation has a powerful incentive to improve the education pipeline. In the   |
| Wodiska     | next decade, two-thirds of new jobs will require some post-secondary education  |
|             | beyond a high school degree. To be competitive and create the conditions for    |
|             | strong economic growth, states need to help all of their residents increase     |
|             | their skills and be prepared for lifelong learning.                             |
|-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| James       | Through a robust system of support that emphasizes rigor and relevance and the  |
| Kohlmoos    | use of scientifically valid research in its solutions, we believe that the      |
|             | increasingly urgent needs for turning around low performing schools can be      |
|             | effectively met.                                                                |

| James M.    | Moving ahead now with this new important emphasis on high school reform will    |
| McPartland  | literally save thousands of American students each year from dropping out with  |
|             | all the means in success for the individuals and for American society.          |
|-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| John        | low-income, African American, and Latino children consistently get less than    |
| Podesta     | their fair share of good teachers.  This must change,                           |
|-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| John        | The fact that taking these successes to scale is very hard, complex work --     |
| Schnur      | that we don't have all of the solutions yet -- should not diminish our          |
|             | commitment to our young people or our educators who are working tirelessly on   |
|             | what they rightly see as America's top domestic priority.                       |

| Joshua      | high-achieving lower-income students disproportionately fall out of the         |

|-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Kevin       | The first priority of this committee should be to further strengthen that       |
| Carey       | commitment to educational equity while embracing a new set of needed reforms    |
|             | for the years to come.                                                          |

| Kristan     | Current policies discourage those who are effective teachers from staying in    |
| van Hook    | the teaching profession and those who could be great teachers from entering     |

|             | tougher assignments.                                                            |
|-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Linda       | Underneath the United States' poor standing is an outcome of both enormous      |
| Darling-    | inequality in school inputs and outcomes and a lack of sufficient focus for all |
| Hammond     | students on higher-order thinking and problem-solving, the areas where all      |
|             | groups in the U.S. do least well on international tests.                        |
|-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| La Ruth     | while eliminating the achievement gap is a worthy goal -- and we agree that it  |

| Michael A.  | we suggest that as you consider specific approaches that may sound right on     |
| Resnick     | paper, that you take pains to determine whether they can actually work where it |

| Michael     | Most high performing countries -- with national, state or local assessments --  |
| Cohen       | operate education systems in a far more coherent policy environment than we do  |
|             | in the U.S., and take different approaches to accountability, professional      |
|             | development for teachers and principals, and other key features of the          |
|             | education system than we do.                                                    |

| Michael D.  | the Council has substantial concerns with the draft bill. We have submitted 30  |
| Casserly    | pages of detailed comments and recommendations on which we pledge to work with  |
|             | the committee.                                                                  |

| MaryKate    | Performance based pay systems should be a small part of a comprehensive plan to |
| Hughes      | improve the recruitment, retention, and training of quality teachers.           |
|-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Michael N.  | Congress has the unique opportunity to work in a bipartisan way to create a     |
| Castle      | bill which strengthens the law while at the same time maintains its core        |
|             | principles of accountability, flexibility and parental choice.                  |
|-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Nelson      | As the Committee works to create NCLB 2.0, we urge that you put much stronger   |
| Smith       | emphasis on creating new, high quality public charter schools where they are    |
|             | most needed -- schools that will foster radically higher academic achievement   |
|             | for children who are still, today, left behind.                                 |
|-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Peter       | If ESEA reforms are ineffective for these large and growing student populations |
| Zamora      | [Latinos] that disproportionately suffer from low academic achievement, ESEA    |
|             | will be ineffective in reforming our public education system as a whole.        |
|-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Rudolph F.  | Common national standards and assessments will eliminate the intellectual and   |
| Crew        | political clutter around expectations, and will force a new focus on the more   |
|             | technical obstacles impeding equity in education.                               |
|-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Reg         | If the only measures we really value are test scores, rather than some of the   |
| Weaver      | other indicators of a rich and challenging educational experience and set of    |
|             | supports provided to students, then we will have missed the mark again about    |
|             | adequately serving and educating all children. We will have avoided yet again   |
|             | the more difficult discussion of what services AND outcomes are important for   |
|             | all stakeholders to be held accountable.                                        |
|-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Stephanie   | The draft appears to move in the right direction on this issue by proposing to  |

| Arne   | Today, all across America, people are meeting the challenge of improving |
| Duncan | education in many different ways -- from creating high-quality early     |
|        | learning programs, to raising standards, improving teacher quality, and  |
|        | aggressively closing achievement gaps and increasing high school and     |
|        | college completion.                                                      |

| George | And we need to reevaluate the federal role in education, as we discussed |
| Miller | last week, we must maintain accountability, but provide states and       |
|        | districts more flexibility where appropriate.                            |

* COMP Classification of Bibliographic references		    :chp:app:
#<<app-lit-refs>>
In this appendix are listed the bibliographic references discussed in [[lit-review][Chapter 2]].

** STRT The Achievement Gaps						:sec:
#<<app-lit-refs-ag>>
In this appendix section are listed the bibliographic references from [[lit-review-gap][Section 2.1]].  Each of the following lists contains in chronological order the contents of each cell in the matrix of Table \ref{tbl:ag-matrix} on page \pageref{tbl:ag-matrix}.  The references were obtained by described on-line database search.  I removed studies that were not relevant to the U.S.A..  In addition, I disregarded papers on the Disability Achievement Gap (DAG) and the Gender Achievement Gap (GAG).  Thus, the 128 bibliographic references were reduced to 72.

The division between Causes and/or Description and Remedies is not clear cut.  Often the authors of a paper that analyzed the AG suggested a remedy. However, I only will consider a paper in the category of Remedy when an actual program to close or narrow the AG was actually implemented and studied.

There is an overlap between papers whose topic of study is the policy aspect of the AGs.  They will be so marked in Table \ref{tbl:ag-policy}.

In Table \ref{tbl:ag-causes-NAG-G} on page \pageref{tbl:ag-causes-NAG-G} are listed the references classified as Causes and/or Description of the General National Achievement Gap.  I marked with a star the references that were selected by the Discourse Analysis search described in [Section 2.2].

* STRT QDA Database Searches 					    :chp:app:
#<<qda-searches>>
In this appendix I present the results of the /RQDA/ database searches for specific *QDA* codes and code combinations.  These results were used in [[discussion][Chapter 5]] on page \pageref{discussion}.  See Table \ref{tbl:qda-codes} and Table \ref{tbl:code-descr} for specifics about the *QDA* codes.  Please note that not all results are mentioned in that chapter.

To search for a specific word or word combination in the *QDA* database use the following /R/ code

#+begin_src R
library("RQDA")
openProject("~/Dropbox/dissertation/data/<my project>.rqda", updateGUI = TRUE)
RQDAQuery("select fid, seltext from coding where seltext like '%my words%';")
#+end_src

In this appendix section are the /R/ codes for the Presidential documents *QDA* database searches and their results.  The code will first query the Presidential documents and then the Congressional hearings.

** COMP Procedures							:sec:
#<<qda-searches-procedures>>

To find the source document paragraphs pertaining to the discussion in [[discussion-dim-1-procedures][Subsection 5.2.2]] on page \pageref{discussion-dim-1-procedures} I performed the following set operation: /EducFunding/ AND /SchoolAccount/ AND (/SchoolFixClose/ OR /StudentAssess/ OR /TeacherAssess/).

I coded this set operation into the following /R/ code

#+begin_src R
